@samgabnz @mtaibbi Yes. His explanation was …unconvincing.
@mtaibbi In light of concerns about Baker’s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today

@thebias_news I take that as a compliment!

@WholeMarsBlog You do, that’s the fundamental difference
The intelligence of this hive-mind will improve significantly as signal/noise, effective cross-linking of tweets &amp; speed of tweets all improve

@lhfang Interesting
@TEDchris @nytimes That’s because ChatGPT is not a far left cause. The New York Times should rename itself The Social Justice Times.

@neontaster ChatGPT is so much better at bullshit than they are!
@WallStreetSilv 🤣🤣
@thevivafrei True lol
@ClayTravis @Twitter @nytimes That is because The New York Times has become, for all intents and purposes, an unregistered lobbying firm for far left politicians
@WillManidis That’s just the publicly disclosed number. His actual support of Dem elections is probably over $1B. The money went somewhere, so where did it go?
@OzraeliAvi I’ve seen a lot of concerning tweets about the recent Brazil election. If those tweets are accurate, it’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates.

@stillgray Oh you mean the same MSM that all colluded to suppress the story? That MSM?
@stillgray 😢
This will be awesome 🍿
What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!
@Jason Agreed
@johnkrausphotos Both false positives and negatives matter
Please screenshot examples that Twitter needs to fix
Not counting those behind the “see more replies” aka probable spam button
"Major Twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spam/scam accounts.

Taking just past 24 hours, does it seem like there are far fewer?"
"Twitter is now serving almost 90 billion tweet impressions per day!

Just how incredibly alive the system actually is will become obvious as we show view count on all tweets."
@EvaFoxU @nytimes 🤣🤣
@BillyM2k Agreed
There are about 500M tweets per day &amp; billions of impressions, so hate speech impressions are &lt;0.1% of what’s seen on Twitter!
@nytimes Utterly false
@Ravii_kc We will publish stats on Love Speech too, as it is vastly higher than Hate Speech!
"Hate speech impressions (# of times tweet was viewed) continue to decline, despite significant user growth!

@TwitterSafety will publish data weekly.

Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom of reach. Negativity should &amp; will get less reach than positivity. https://t.co/36zl29rCSM"
@Kristennetten Please report accounts doing so. Repeated harassment falls into the spam category, so will result in a temp suspension.
@kylenabecker That resulted in a major spike. Twitter will be publishing actual “hate speech” (same list company has always used) impressions later today &amp; every week going forward.
@BillyM2k The (currently) quiet majority should tweet more!
"You know Twitter is being fair when extremists on far right and far left are simultaneously upset!

Twitter aims to serve center 80% of people, who wish to learn, laugh &amp; engage in reasoned debate. ❤️"

"@KimDotcom @kanyewest Just clarifying that his account is being suspended for incitement to violence, not an unflattering pic of me being hosed by Ari. 

Frankly, I found those pics to be helpful motivation to lose weight!"
@TheeAleexJ @kanyewest I tried my best. Despite that, he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.
@kanyewest This is not

"@jordanbpeterson Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.

There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!"
@araghougassian @Spooks View count will show how many people actually see tweets, just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!
"@araghougassian @Spooks The problem is that likes are public, subjecting people to criticism, and “like” is often the wrong description, as you often just think something is interesting or notable, but not likable. 

We need to add these critical distinctions."
@Spooks Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets, just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem.
"@Spooks Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)? 

Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%."
"I meet so many people who read twitter every day, but almost never tweet.

Update from @Neuralink at 6pm PT
@NorthmanTrader @vincent13031925 Exactly
@vincent13031925 Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.

If Community Notes can correct me, then obviously they can correct anyone. This is a good example. They were right to add the label.
@TheQuartering I think I have been very specific
@DavidSacks It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
@cb_doge @stillgray @ezralevant @latimes That one was real too
"@stillgray @ezralevant @latimes The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!

@02100_eth That might be cool to show publicly, now that you mention it
@BillyM2k You probably weren’t blocking 4000 accounts per second
@VassiliosBitsas Friends have asked me if there’s a way to recover their old vine videos! Will look into it.

@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k That’s literally how I found out!

Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.

@SamTwits More importantly, I was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster. Eberhard was wealthy and could have risked his money, but was unwilling to do so.
@stillgray For many celebrities, it’s actually their manager or “team” writing their tweets. Might be the case here.

@AMC_Apee Wow
"@TimRunsHisMouth But freedom of speech is the bedrock of a strong democracy and must take precedence.

My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far."
@TimRunsHisMouth As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump
@mtaibbi Interesting development
"@TimRunsHisMouth I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account, despite no violation of the law or terms of service.

Deplatforming a sitting President undermined public trust in Twitter for half of America."
@Liz_Wheeler I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone
@stillgray Concerning
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Calling for violence will result in suspension
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Absolutely
"@Esqueer_ Incitement to violence will result in account suspension. 

Currently suspended accounts will be enabled slowly next week after manual review to determine whether they have potentially broken the law or engaged in spam.

Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views."
@stillgray Accurate
@MattWallace888 @saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich If it actually becomes a problem, we will take those and other steps
"@saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich Deliberate impersonation/deception will result in account suspension.

There needs to be a counter-narrative."
@realGeorgeHotz We can aspire to turn it to the betterment of all
What do you think of the culture war?
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul That is a disturbing story and very concerning that Twitter took no action, despite clear violation of ToS. Report in this thread for now.
"@Cryptoking @RBReich All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes “notable” is otherwise too subjective.

Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.

Longer explanation next week."
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
"@Cryptoking @RBReich Sorry for the delay, we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week. 

Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates. 

Painful, but necessary."
@RBReich Interesting … now pay $8
@stillgray @axios Much Ado About Nothing
@AP But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
@AP AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
@ThePrashanthCB @viniciuscfp82 Mars plans are still moving forward
@viniciuscfp82 How can it be both illegal and “by the court”? Twitter must abide by the laws of each country or get shut down.

@slashdot @dealbook This is one the biggest failures in US journalistic integrity of the 21st century
@ParikPatelCFA Lol, but actually true
"@BillyM2k The more I learn, the worse it gets. The world should know the truth of what has been happening at Twitter.

Transparency will earn the trust of the people."
@BillyM2k 💯🎯
@RyanZohoury @WholeMarsBlog @semaforben Good point. Conflicts of interest should be made readily apparent to the reader.
@sourpatchlyds @semaforben Just wow …
@WholeMarsBlog @semaforben They should get a “SBF-Affiliated Media” label 🤣
@WholeMarsBlog @semaforben Yup
@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben 🤣
@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben That’s why he won’t answer
@semaforben To be direct, the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill.
"@semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company, but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did, when in fact he owns 0%. 

For the last time, how much of you does SBF own? Stop dodging the question."
@greg_price11 Yes
@vanschneider To be fair, there are many people at Twitter working late into the night, for whom I have great respect
@Jason 🤣
Awesome new Twitter merch! https://t.co/zqdL9xGRuR
"@EricRWeinstein It has been really bad. Far left San Francisco/Berkeley views have been propagated to the world via Twitter. 

I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone watching closely.

Twitter is moving rapidly to establish an even playing field. No more thumb on the scale!"
@jonesville @BusinessInsider It’s not a real publication
@DavidSacks 🤣🤣 with maybe a little editorial help from SBF’s employees @semafor
@DogePotamus @dogehodl2021 @StephenKing This is awesome
@EricNewcomer @karaswisher No grey area. Flat wrong.
@EricNewcomer @karaswisher On the other @semafor *did* take the SBF money and @semaforben won’t disclose how much SBF owns of them
@EricNewcomer @karaswisher I did not take the money. SBF/FTX do not own shares in Twitter.
World Cup traffic hit almost 20,000 tweets per second today! Great work by Twitter team managing record usage.
@StephenKing Headline: “Stephen King Tweet Causes My Pillow Sales to Skyrocket!” Lmaooo
@DennisCricket_ Haha sorry code release towards end of next week should allow this again
@David_Ingram @semaforben @semafor No. He may have owned shares in Twitter as a public company, but he certainly does not own shares in Twitter as a private company.
@karaswisher There was a time when you cared about the truth. That is long gone.
"@semaforben @semafor As I said, neither I nor Twitter have taken any investment from SBF/FTX. Your article is a lie. 

Now, I’m asking again, how much of you does SBF own?"
@wintonARK It was getting to the point where the minimum impulse bit for a Silicon Valley startup was a billion dollar market cap!
Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?
@Timcast 🎯🤣
@engineers_feed @Twitter So much to fix at Twitter (sigh)
@StatistaCharts There are lies, there are damn lies, and then there is Statista

"@ZacksJerryRig According to Obama’s DoJ, the Ferguson shooting was unequivocally self-defense, so the Ferguson protests were – if you believe Obama’s DoJ – based on a false premise.

@Rainmaker1973 @gunsnrosesgirl3 Looking into it
@Rainmaker1973 There was an error last week where the system incorrectly suspended &amp; deboosted your account. I’m told that those are now cleared.
@JohnPhillips Truth over time builds trust. Nothing else.
@elizableu I would like to know too
@semaforben @semafor What percentage of you does he own?
@hiromichimizuno Congratulations
More and more over time, as we hew closer to the truth, Twitter will earn the trust of the people
I hope you get that which truly makes you happy
@MattWallace888 @semafor Inmates are running the asylum at WaPo while Jeff parties in his hot tub
@realchasegeiser 🤣🤣 worth it
@semafor What’s going on here @semaforben?
@semafor Semafor is owned by SBF. This is a massive conflict of interest in your reporting. Journalistic integrity is 🗑️. https://t.co/1AB6KReJUj

@kimbal @TheEconomist Nice
Wasn’t Twitter supposed to die by now or something … ?
"@PatrickW @kylenabecker @Twitter A large coalition of political/social activist groups agreed not to try to kill Twitter by starving us of advertising revenue if I agreed to this condition.

They broke the deal."
@DineshDSouza Correct
@kylenabecker @Twitter Not even Associated Press with their completely fictional report on Russian missiles hitting Poland that carried severe consequences for escalating the war
@wizecrax @stillgray @kylenabecker @Twitter This is messed up
@kylenabecker @Twitter As is obvious to all but the media, there is not one permanent ban on even the most far left account spouting utter lies
@kylenabecker @Twitter True

@alexxubyte Twitter search will add feedback loops to improve result rank based on which result you click on &amp; whether you immediately click back (implies wrong result)
"@alexxubyte Notes from last night:
- Maybe deprecate TLS this week, as only needed if Android app &gt;1 year old.
- Home mixer computes Home  ~10X faster than Timeline.
- Ad mixer can greatly improve relevance at cost of lower total ad views. More interesting the ad, more time you look at it."

@MuskUniversity (cue Obama giving himself a medal meme)
@MuskUniversity Exactly
@schrep Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.
"@schrep True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced, but that can’t solve weak Internet connections &amp; older phones.

Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone."
@WholeMarsBlog Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space, so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website
"@schrep There are ~1200 “microservices” server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team. 

Trimming down that 1200 number, reducing data usage, serialized trips &amp; simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use."
"@schrep Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact, not “claim”.

10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes, it doesn’t work at all, especially on Android phones.

Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app."

@nichegamer @abhiharry726 @sampullara That’s what I said!
@abhiharry726 @sampullara In some parts of the world, refresh takes 30 seconds
@Popeska @sampullara How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?
@sampullara And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …
@sampullara Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!
"@sampullara I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter, which matches # of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.

Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long), but ~20 secs in India, due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low."
@mishaboar @MattWallace888 That is not good

@TaraBull808 @MarioNawfal @KimDotcom @RealChetBLong @favrue3 @cvpayne @AlderLaneEggs @bennyjohnson @catturd2 @RealCandaceO A question worth asking
@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd I’m ready through the list right now
"@EricFrohnhoefer @MEAInd True, the food is great. 

The fact that you don’t realize that there are up to 1200 “microservices” being called when someone uses the Twitter app is not great."
@FBIPantyRaid @ThisIsKyleR Interesting
@rmotta2 It’s on my list to review. How urgent is this?
@SawyerMerritt That is my philosophy
@jimcramer @JohnLegere Umm … no

@EricFrohnhoefer Then please correct me. What is the right number?
"@_hawko False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%, average occupancy below 10%.

@219_eth 🧐
@dennishegstad We will enable organizations to manage affiliations
@engineers_feed Output of any company is the vector sum of people within it. Someone may be a strong vector, but negatively affect those around them to such a degree that they are a net negative.
Btw, I’d like to apologize for Twitter being super slow in many countries. App is doing &gt;1000 poorly batched RPCs just to render a home timeline!
@jessica_kirsh @SpaceX @TeslaAIBot @Tesla Cool :)
@johnkrausphotos Ultimately, I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter, but I’m open to suggestions
Rolling out soon, Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them

@JohnLegere @HolyKnightKeith @Twitter @MikeSievert @TMobile I like both you and Mike! It’s just that Twitter at its core is a software &amp; servers company. The technology needs to evolve rapidly, which requires a technologist.
@JohnLegere @Twitter No
@TomFitton SBF was a major Dem donor, so no investigation
@dogeofficialceo @SenMarkey @washingtonpost 🤣🤣
@SenMarkey @washingtonpost And why does your pp have a mask!?
@SenMarkey @washingtonpost Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?
@BLKMDL3 @DirtyTesLa @WholeMarsBlog Rollout will broaden roughly every week

@slashdot No way
@debarghya_das @ayushkhd @Tesla Making Tesla Superchargers &amp; connectors available to all is the right thing to do
@A_MrBenMitchell @RadioShack @MarioNawfal Spaces should be evolve. It has potential to be truly great.

@philbak1 My reaction to SBF was … different
@MarioNawfal Twitter at its best!

@kellymilkies @tomasverdugo @balinares 🎯
@elephantbridge @balinares Yes
"@balinares This is false. Anyone who can be in office, should be. However, if not logistically possible or they have essential personal matters, then staying home is fine.

Working remotely is also ok if their manager vouches for excellence.

Same policy as Tesla &amp; SpaceX."

We’re adding a “Parody” subscript to clarify
@chicago_glenn @BernieSanders @CommunityNotes 🤣
"@BernieSanders Full answer to insulin price question is complex. Short answer is that original insulin, discovered in 1921 (not 1923), is inexpensive, costing as little as $25.

Mainstream media will still thrive, but increased competition from citizens will cause them to be more accurate, as their oligopoly on information is disrupted
@stillgray True
This is from the video arcade &amp; bar area
@EvaFoxU Interesting

@TeslaTomMY1 2023 will probably be tough, but my companies are positioned well

@stillgray @EmmanuelMacron We will take action in this regard
Quite the day!
@EmmanuelMacron Absolument
@WholeMarsBlog I agree
@stillgray Absolutely
@FeuxManning Yes
To be more precise, accounts doing parody impersonations. Basically, tricking people is not ok.
Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include “parody” in their name, not just in bio
@stoolpresidente Even I paid $8, no discount
Usage of Twitter continues to rise. One thing is for sure: it isn’t boring!
@DojaCat You should be able to change your name now
@gainzy222 I’d watch that movie 🍿
@kcoleman Community Notes is a gamechanger for improving accuracy on Twitter!

@Teslaconomics It’s awesome 🫐
@DojaCat Pretty funny though 🤣🤣
@DojaCat Working on it!
@GooseWayn That’s coming
@Pentosh1 You’re welcome!
@TeslaAIBot 🤣
"@micsolana Rollout of new verified Blue is intentionally limited just to iOS in a few countries with very little promotion. 

As we iron out issues, we will expand worldwide on all platforms."
@micsolana In days to come, we’ll add granularity to verified badge, such as organizational affiliation &amp; ID verification
@micsolana We are changing the text to say “Legacy Verified. Could be notable, but could also be bogus.”
@guslabu @tomwarren 🎯😎💰
@StarringShane Subscription Blue is better than legacy Blue. I switched over.
@PPathole The goal of Twitter DMs is to superset Signal

@ID_AA_Carmack Should be noted that a significant percentage of these accounts are not real people, but some proportion are
"@jasontoff This is super messed up. Unfortunately, many such things occurred at Twitter. Even worse was done in later years.

"Twitter is the worst!

@stevekrenzel Wow, this is messed up!
@WholeMarsBlog Politics is war and truth is the first casualty
@PPathole @mayemusk While it’s true that I’ve been under unfair &amp; misleading attack for some time by leading Democrats, my motivation here is for centrist governance, which matches the interests of most Americans
@BillyM2k @laoisman80 @hankgreen Exactly
@yoyoel Important thread
@BillyM2k 🤣🤷‍♂️
@ID_AA_Carmack https://t.co/pgTSY1zIdc
@HeidiBriones 💯
https://t.co/3t5ahItE5z
I just hope the servers don’t melt!
Twitter usage is at an all-time high lol
@EvaFoxU 🤣
And I’m open to the idea of voting Democrat again in the future
@BillyM2k 🤣🤣💯
To be clear, my historical party affiliation has been Independent, with an actual voting history of entirely Democrat until this year
@MattWallace888 @hankgreen True
"@hankgreen Like most people in America, I agree with some of the Democrat and some of the Republican policies, but not all.

However, if executive and legislative branches are dominated by *one* party, then we lose balance of power."
Hardcore Democrats or Republicans never vote for the other side, so independent voters are the ones who actually decide who’s in charge!
"To independent-minded voters:

Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic."
But if Twitter is bird, that’s means … 🤯
Back when birds were real
How times have changed https://t.co/gCxUkZ4kZC
@TomFitton @Twitter We do
Twitter rules will evolve over time, but they’re currently the following: https://t.co/Ut1tXuefso
@greg16676935420 @jack Birds haven’t been real since 1986 https://t.co/lR6BZj0nwX
@mcuban $8 for all
@stillgray @jack Exactly
@jack Not everything needs to have “bird” in the name! Too many bird groups fighting each internally other at Twitter. Angry Birds.
@jack Birdwatch gives me the creeps
@SarahKSilverman Community Notes aka @birdwatch
@GPrime85 @bennyjohnson @kathygriffin 🤣
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin For $8
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin But if she really wants her account back, she can have it
@bennyjohnson @kathygriffin Actually, she was suspended for impersonating a comedian
@stillgray At the end of the day, if Twitter is indeed the most accurate source of information, more people will use it
@jack As judged by the people of Twitter via Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch)
@RationalEtienne @kylegrantham Absolutely
@kylegrantham You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information. That’s the big lie.
@realpfigueiredo @JosianoPadovani @reportersalles I will look into this
@stevenmarkryan Accurate
My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk
Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
"@alex_avoigt Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced.

And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth, it will be indispensable."
@BillyM2k @StonksReddit No problem to use a pseudonym. The high-level principle is just that verified users can’t engage in malicious deception.
@dogeofficialceo @EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow 🤣
@EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation, as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization
Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
@catturd2 No exceptions
Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
"Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning. 

This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue."
@JosianoPadovani @reportersalles What censorship are you referring to?
Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying “parody” will be permanently suspended
@SnazzyQ @CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro We can beat that
@birdwatch Worth watching
@michaelmiraflor Fixing search is a high priority
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut Noted to fix
Search within Twitter reminds me of Infoseek in ‘98! That will also get a lot better pronto.
@CorySteuben @Erdayastronaut @live_munro Interesting
@gchahal @TwitterBlue 42 mins to start, then several hours in a month or so
@BillyM2k @nikitabier We definitely need to incent people to do a lot more interactions on Twitter!
@stephsmithio 🤣
"@Erdayastronaut We can do 42 min chunks at 1080 resolution now for new Blue, so you could break up a longer video. The 42 min limit should be fixed next month.

How does YouTube monetization work &amp; what could Twitter do better?"
@stillgray Absolutely
@Cricprabhu Hopefully, less than a month
@AdamFostermusic Absolutely
@Jorge_Most_ Two weeks
@mahdi Something like that
Followed by creator monetization for all forms of content
Twitter will soon add ability to attach long-form text to tweets, ending absurdity of notepad screenshots
@aaroncohn30 @IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Couple months
@RenataKonkoly @raaahulpandey @TeslaAIBot True
"@raaahulpandey Great question. Twitter will suspend the account attempting impersonation and keep the money! 

So if scammers want to do this a million times, that’s just a whole bunch of free money. https://t.co/QUrxqb59I0"
This rocks https://t.co/sB1sL0Hdrv
@ProfitsTaken So long as pay $8, please be my guest
@SamTwits 🙏
@IGrabill @scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan That is weirdly tricky due to the way Apple handles “subscriptions”. If you subscribed to the old thing, it’s not super smooth to subscribe to the new thing. We’re working on it.
@TerribleMaps 🤣🤣
@WSBChairman @BillyM2k Yup
@MarkRuffalo Hot take: not everything AOC says is 💯 accurate
@scottbelsky @kcoleman @AlexMahadevan This feature is an absolute gamechanger for fighting mis/disinformation at scale
@SirineAti @BillyM2k As soon as we confirm it’s working well in the initial set of countries and we have the translation work done, it will roll out worldwide
@Tesmanian_com Making great actuators for a humanoid robot is a surprisingly hard problem
@alex_avoigt I still do a lot of work at Tesla! Was at our Palo Alto engineering office until late Thursday night when I had to redeye to NY.
@kcoleman @ubiquity75 🤣💯
"@BillyM2k Far too many legacy “verified” checkmarks were handed out, often arbitrarily, so in reality they are *not* verified. You can buy as many as you want right now with a Google search.

Piggybacking off payment system plus Apple/Android is a much better way to ensure verification."
@BillyM2k https://t.co/BJSDuJIdLK
@Techgnostik @alex_avoigt Correct
https://t.co/4UQlClBSct
@kcoleman @AlexMahadevan Birdwatch (soon to be renamed Community Notes) has incredible potential for improving information accuracy on Twitter!
Trash me all day, but it’ll cost $8
@DanRather $8

"@mrddmia Thank you. 

A thermonuclear name &amp; shame is exactly what will happen if this continues."
"Regarding Twitter’s reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.

Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required."
@TomFitton @Twitter @yoyoel @JudicialWatch Twitter will not censor accurate information about anything
"Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.

In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press."
Excellent summary of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety from the head of the team https://t.co/sJ1MBf9Mub
@hankgreen Hank, try a Google search …
@marenkahnert @hankgreen 🤣💯
@dogeofficialceo @hankgreen 🤣🤣
@ZssBecker Agreed. Working on it.
@hankgreen And therefore Twitter should die?
@stillgray You’re right
"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.

Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America."
@WalterIsaacson Absolutely
@TomFitton That assessment is more accurate than most people realize
@jonastyle_ @waitbutwhy 🤣
"@waitbutwhy Unsure if confirming or denying that

@satiricaldissi1 🤣
A neuron doesn’t realize it’s a neuron
@CookieCrumb35 Pretty much, or at least one of the hive minds
… with a lot of room for improvement
Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic super-intelligence

you get what you pay for
"@Rubiu5 If verified accounts violate terms of service, eg spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!

We will definitely add cool stuff like what you’re suggesting to Twitter Blue."
@MichaelDell Thanks Michael
@bennyjohnson Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints
@HSajwanization Exactly!
"@micsolana The community notes feature is awesome.

@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter's content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views, which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence
@yoyoel @JGreenblattADL @YaelEisenstat @rashadrobinson @JGo4Justice @normanlschen @DerrickNAACP @TheBushCenter @SindyBenavides Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks
@yoyoel Talked to civil society leaders @JGreenblattADL, @YaelEisenstat, @rashadrobinson, @JGo4Justice, @normanlschen, @DerrickNAACP, @TheBushCenter Ken Hersch &amp; @SindyBenavides about how Twitter will continue to combat hate &amp; harassment &amp; enforce its election integrity policies
@foundmyfitness I think so

"@saylor Yes, this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam/scam, that account will be suspended. 

Essentially, this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude."
@Gfilche Absolutely essential. Creators need to make a living!
This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators
@Emmonspired @MKBHD Exactly
@jimmyfailla 🤣👻
And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us
"You will also get:
- Priority in replies, mentions &amp; search, which is essential to defeat spam/scam
- Ability to post long video &amp; audio

@RenataKonkoly @ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Those who want Putin removed are laboring under the misapprehension that whoever replaces him will be more amenable to peace or western philosophy, but I think this is unlikely – the Kremlin is not the Nice Guy Olympics
@ThorstenBasch @spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Russia overrunning Ukraine would destabilize the entire region, perhaps the world
@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k If Russia faced calamitous defeat in conventional warfare for something as strategically critical as Crimea, the probability of using nuclear weapons is high
@jamesplloyd @SpaceX I do. Yes.
@spideycyp_155 @BillyM2k Still very unlikely, but this is the closest we’ve been since Cuba in ‘62

@SawyerMerritt @SpaceX SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding
"@starrski71 @RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Wrong analogy. America also had a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one in America sees that country as part of America.

Crimea *is* seen as a crucial part of Russia by Russia, much as Hawaii is seen as a crucial part of America."
@EnjoyerFive 🎯🤣
@PPathole @spideycyp_155 Probably not
@zerohedge Practice makes perfect …
"@RenataKonkoly @EvaFoxU @kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine. 

But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total, humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high."
"@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 Obviously many disagree with this logic, but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3. 

If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools."
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise.
@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over
"@spideycyp_155 Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia. 

Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.

From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor."
@hyiki22 @spideycyp_155 Exactly
"@spideycyp_155 If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.

We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose? 

If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3."

@RaheemKassam The hilarious thing is you’re not wrong 🤣
@EvaFoxU So it goes …
@gainzy222 Fate loves irony
@DavidSacks Even so, we should still do good deeds
The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money &amp; other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free
@Brian_J_Berger That dude is not just a “condition of anonymity” spineless coward, he’s also an ignorant fool. Starlink was directly requested by the Ukraine government, as it was the only thing that worked.
@spideycyp_155 @PPathole @ashleevance It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war.
@ashleevance DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context.
@PPathole @ashleevance Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.
@ashleevance The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesn’t work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does.
"@ajtourville Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.

In any given year, there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.

@nichegamer This has potential
"@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Internet fiber, phone lines, cell towers &amp; other space-based comms in war areas have been destroyed. 

Starlink is all that’s left. For now.

https://t.co/CdjbOWgziz"
@FedorovMykhailo Thank you for clarifying this 💙🇺🇦💛
@StonksReddit @rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Starlink is the primary communications system of the Ukrainian army on the war front. If anyone else wants this job, please be my guest …
"@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms. 

Starlink is only comms system still working at warfront – others all dead. 

Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink. To safeguard, SpaceX has diverted massive resources towards defense.

Even so, Starlink may still die."

@EvaFoxU @Nobody_Really7 @EvaKBartlett https://t.co/XTWjF4lv9o
@stillgray Are there citizens of nations who are helping Ukraine on this list?

@EvaKBartlett Is this list real? What’s the URL?
@Rainmaker1973 People should never fear turbulence. Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.
@mtaibbi The right question to ask
@officejjsmart @MelnykAndrij We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️
@narutium @SawyerMerritt Falcon can probably get Starlink past breakeven, but Starship is needed to fund Mars
@TeslaOwnersEBay @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Yes
"@spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain &amp; replenish satellites &amp; ground stations &amp; pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways. 

We’ve also had to defend against cyberattacks &amp; jamming, which are getting harder.

Burn is approaching ~$20M/month."
"@SawyerMerritt Also, Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.

When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference, I said “not go bankrupt”."

Most of Ukraine unequivocally wants to be part of Ukraine, but some eastern portions have Russian majorities and prefer Russia."

@TEDchris Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy vision
"@KonstantinKisin I do not think it is simple at all, but I have yet to hear any realistic path to peace.

Ukraine has achieved many brilliant tactical victories, but should be wary of overconfidence leading to strategic defeat.

When Russia fully mobilizes, millions on both sides will die."
@WholeMarsBlog 10.69.3 will actually be a major upgrade. We’re keeping .69 just because haha.
@LarckeningXuruo Twitter probably accelerates X by 3 to 5 years, but I could be wrong
Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app
@BillyM2k @unusual_whales 🤣
@SawyerMerritt Should be noted that Starlink is still far from cash flow positive. All LEO communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt, so any support is super helpful.
@FrenchyRagin @Kasparov63 A small number of terminals were paid for by the govt, vast majority were not. This is just another bs WaPo hit piece.
@ZelenskyyUa I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world.
"@Kasparov63 We gave Starlinks to Ukraine &amp; lost $80M+ in doing so, while putting SpaceX &amp; myself at serious risk of Russian cyberattack.

What have you done besides tweet?"
"@DavidSacks SpaceX’s out of pocket cost to enable &amp; support Starlink in Ukraine is ~$80M so far. Our support for Russia is $0. Obviously, we are pro Ukraine.

Trying to retake Crimea will cause massive death, probably fail &amp; risk nuclear war. This would be terrible for Ukraine &amp; Earth."
@slashdot In other news, remote controlled anal beads sold out everywhere
@micsolana 🤣
@spideycyp_155 @StonksReddit @Podolyak_M That referendum was questionable, which is why I suggested repeating it under UN (or other trusted entity) supervision
@StonksReddit @Podolyak_M Great, offer a UN supervised vote and if Russia refuses, then war it is
@Podolyak_M Maybe a similar approach to Kosovo https://t.co/cGPpaXAaA3
@Podolyak_M No, I’m suggesting voting under UN (or pick your most trusted entity or country) supervision
"@RenataKonkoly Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.

Russia has &gt;3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace."
"@RenataKonkoly You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care.

I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome."
Let’s try this then: the will of the people who live in the Donbas &amp; Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine
@PopMech Cheese is amazing
@Nemli_mot Indeed. Biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.
@raulsanchezuk The bot attack on this poll is strong!
@AkiKivirinta The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine, but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine
Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war
This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then
"Ukraine-Russia Peace:

- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

- Water supply to Crimea assured.

- Ukraine remains neutral."
@jasondebolt Yes
@jasondebolt That is my assessment too
@tim_zaman Well-said! Also, we try to operate the team as non-hierarchically as possible &amp; allow movement between project areas, so you don’t get pigeon-holed.

@PPathole @RBReich https://t.co/82b0Msiktf
@BnOrdhaug @yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini That’s the plan. We’re taking a little  risk there, as engine isolation was done as retrofit, so not as good as on Booster 9.
@yasin_shafiei @thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Late next month maybe, but November seems highly likely. We will have two boosters &amp; ships ready for orbital flight by then, with full stack production at roughly one every two months.
@thejackbeyer @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @NicAnsuini Our focus is on reliability upgrades for flight on Booster 7 and completing Booster 9, which has many design changes, especially for full engine RUD isolation.

@WholeMarsBlog @jonbbc @aelluswamy 10.69.2 goes out to 100k owners next week
@MuskUniversity SJM question
Spent the day walking entire Giga Berlin production line – team is doing excellent work!
@jonbbc @WholeMarsBlog @aelluswamy 10.69.1 is even better. We reduced latency &amp; jitter in hardware command loop, so time from object detection to brake actuation is 10% to 20% better.
Kickass Internet connection coming Royal Caribbean ships soon! https://t.co/8qJRiUuNah
@MuskUniversity It’s true
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Ancient times
@teslaownersSV It will grow by at least 5 to 10 meters over time
"@WholeMarsBlog First few days, just 1k owners, but going to 10k if no major issues. 

Note, 10.69.2, hopefully going out week after this, is the wide release beta."
@MuskUniversity Good to ask yourself this often
"@CSI_Starbase Agreed, we recently made this change &amp; many others.

"@ID_AA_Carmack Similarly high cycle life with nickel cathode is possible if optimizing for that.

@heydave7 Yes
(And I do think global warming is a major risk)

@BBC_Future I would gladly obey their commands, but I can’t tell what they’re saying!
"@RationalEtienne @arctechinc I do not doubt that. Criticism, public or private, is welcome after we go to wide beta. 

Early beta has many known issues. The reason we release it to a limited number of cars is to discover unknown issues."
"@RationalEtienne @arctechinc No. Let me make something clear: James contacted me directly to be included in *early* beta, which is only ~1000 cars, mostly employees. 

Early beta explicitly has issues or it would be rolled out widely, so publicly criticizing something he had asked for is wrong."

Neuralink progress update show &amp; tell on October 31 st (Halloween)
"2 main goals this year: 

- Starship to orbit
- FSD wide release

Many other things, of course, but those are the 2 giant kahunas. Will require insane work by many super talented people, but, if anyone can do it, they can. 

It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings."
It is the fastest way to get between one downtown and another with known physics (and the Standard Model is proving quiet resilient)!

"@chazman @aelluswamy Glad it’s working out! Thanks for giving us this tough case to solve. That’s what field testing is all about.

This early version of 10.69 is being extra cautious, so waits for a moderately big gap in traffic to cross. Upcoming releases will do better in heavy traffic."
@chazman @aelluswamy Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible.
Note, you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app
"After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th. 

Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th, but delivered later."
"FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward!

10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release.

1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants."
@BLKMDL3 @Tesla Tesla Autopilot/AI team did great work with 10.69! Some point releases needed for polish, so 10.69.2 should really shine.
@Teslarati @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @JohnnaCrider1 🤔
@aelluswamy Worth hearing about Tesla Autopilot software/AI progress
@WholeMarsBlog As mentioned previously, this is a major release, so we need to be cautious. Goes out to ~1000 Beta participants later today.

@BillyM2k Arguably, we know more than nothing. “Death &amp; taxes are a certainty” – BF.
@karpathy Also worth getting a particle counter
@OwenSparks_ @karpathy It’s on the future product list. Especially important in places like Austin, which has next-level amounts of pollen in the air.
@konstructivizm Things will get wild when Andromeda collides with our galaxy!
@energybants @Liv_Boeree They should keep running
@karpathy True. I have a CO2 monitor on my desk. It beeps whenever ppm&gt;1000.
@SpaceX @Space_Station About twice as much useful mass to orbit as rest of Earth combined
@tanayj Absolutely
"@Erdayastronaut @LevEakins More accurate word is “propellant”, rather than “fuel”. Starship is ~78% liquid oxygen, ~22% fuel.

Propellant cost is of primary importance for a fully reusable rocket, so reusable rockets want high thrust, as thrust below T/W of 1 is irrelevant."
@Rainmaker1973 I use this example a lot
"@TJ_Cooney @SpaceX Starlink bandwidth varies a lot, depending on user terminal density &amp; time of day. That’s why the long wait in some areas.

Throughput is roughly linear with total V1 satellites in operation. V2 satellites are at least 5 times better (conservative estimate) than V1."

@cb_doge Actually true. Then I suggested to the team that it didn’t need to be quite so pointy, since that’s just based on a movie joke, but everyone likes it pointy, so we kept it that way.

Engines themselves &amp; booster base are extremely robust. High strength stainless steel is bulletproof to a handgun at ~2.5mm thickness. Booster dome is 4mm."
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Electric power for booster &amp; ship is needed even when engines aren’t running &amp; incremental power draw of TVC isn’t too bad. We have local supercaps on each engine to deal with power spikes.
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Enabling engines to take the heat without shrouds might save over 10 tons, all things considered.

Shrouds are also a risk in that fuel leaks could be contained by the shroud, forming a MOX bomb.

Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this."
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.

Raptors in production now have electric TVC, saving over a ton of hydraulics mass on booster."
Dragon launching in 2 mins https://t.co/DBQDCbBy6B
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 Most importantly, we need to delete or thermally protect remaining secondary structure, so we can remove shrouds

"@JoeTalkShow @BreitbartNews Yeah, but too much drama. Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!?

Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69."
"@BreitbartNews I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat &amp; sail into the sunset.

@slashdot Apple’s store is like having a 30% tax on the Internet. Definitely not ok.
@dogecoin_empire I was going full Looney Tunes haha
@teslaownersSV @28delayslater Tesla is now over 110k direct jobs and roughly 500k indirect, factoring in suppliers
@28delayslater Talked to an NPC with aggro==255
@teslaownersSV @heydave7 No
@heydave7 Starlink is awesome for RV’s, camping or any activity away from cities
"@WholeMarsBlog That is why we must clear out bots, spam &amp; scams. Is something actually public opinion or just someone operating 100k fake accounts? Right now, you can’t tell.

And algorithms must be open source, with any human intervention clearly identified.

Then, trust will be deserved."
@WholeMarsBlog There is so much potential with Twitter to be the most trusted &amp; broadly inclusive forum in the world!
@PPathole 🤣
"@daelmor Yeah, kids starting with lots of money usually have much less motivation than those who have nothing. 

When we started our first company (Zip2) in 95, I had over $100k of student debt, a computer I built myself and a few thousand dollars."

"Since I’ve been asked a lot:

Buy stock in several companies that make products &amp; services that *you* believe in.

Only sell if you think their products &amp; services are trending worse. Don’t panic when the market does.

This will serve you well in the long-term."
@vallioo @pmarca Munger is correct
@TheCaptain_Nemo @pmarca Major problem. Passive/index managers should vote in the best interests of shareholders, not shift responsibility to proxy advisory firms.
"@pegobry @pmarca Exactly. Right before he died, Jack Bogle (of Vanguard fame) said index/passive funds were too great a percentage of the market and he really knew what he was talking about! 

There should be a shift back towards active investment. Passive has gone too far."
@pmarca Exactly, decisions are being made on behalf of actual shareholders that are contrary to their interests! Major problem with index/passive funds.
@BillyM2k Not a bad idea

@PPathole @pmarca A friend just emailed me about her bad Ritalin experience. Best to be cautious with all neurotransmitter drugs.
@PPathole @pmarca I have not heard bad things about Ritalin, which is not good to say it’s good, just haven’t heard bad things about it
"@pmarca Wellbutrin is way worse than Adderall imo. It should be taken off the market.

@teslaownersSV @28delayslater Update probably goes to wide release next week. This is a big one.
@28delayslater True haha
@WholeMarsBlog The people of Twitter strongly agree that Twitter needs to be fixed
"But I’m no fan of the far right either.

I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. 

If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.

@Teslaconomics Yup
@JohnnaCrider1 @stats_feed Underground tunnels are immune to surface weather conditions (subways are a good example), so it wouldn’t matter to Hyperloop if a hurricane was raging on the surface. You wouldn’t even notice.
"@JohnnaCrider1 @stats_feed In the coming years, Boring Co will attempt to build a working Hyperloop.

@teslaownersSV @DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Ok sure
@Tesla__Mania @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Yes
@garyblack00 The failures are mine, the successes belong to others
@DimaZeniuk @billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty I should, but that would take a lot of time away from Tesla, SpaceX &amp; other work. Walter Isaacson is writing a book.
@PPathole @teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Exactly
"@billhuang688 @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty I put in all I had, whereas Eberhard, who was worth over $10M at the time, refused to invest a penny to help Tesla.

"@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty But if he was actually capable of creating a company like Tesla, he would have done so after he was fired for lying outrageously about cost &amp; progress of Roadster in mid 2007.

We would’ve lost at least a few talented people if he was the real deal, but we lost no one."
@teslaownersSV @woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty They say history is written by the victors, but not on Wikipedia if the losing party is still alive &amp; has lots of time on their hands!
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty When Eberhard was fired unanimously by the board in July 2007 (for damn good reasons), no one left with him. That says it all.
@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty If filing a shell corp constitutes “founding a company”, then I’d be the only founder of PayPal, since I filed the original incorporation docs for https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy (later renamed PayPal), but that’s not what founding means.
"@woonomic @VaibhavSisinty Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard.

"@thesheetztweetz @QuiltyAnalytics SpaceX default plan was ~65% of global launch mass to orbit this year. Incremental demand might take that to ~70%, so not a major change. Those numbers don’t count Starship.

@JonErlichman Or Tesla!
"Interesting
https://t.co/548FHpnnxU"
@nichegamer It’s good
@PPathole @Tesla That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve – last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.
@cyantist It was a shamefully low blow from WSJ
@WholeMarsBlog And many other things
@davidjkon @Tesmanian_com No, that’s some tool with senior editor privileges who keeps putting that there
@Tesmanian_com “History is written by the victors” except on Wikipedia, as your enemies are still alive &amp; have lots of time on their hands 🤣🤣
@Tesmanian_com My wiki is such a dumpster fire 🤣🤣. That’s how you know it isn’t curated.
@GerberKawasaki A lot will be added
Tesla holiday software update goes to wide release today!
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is technically a car like an iPhone is technically a phone
10.8 looks good, rolling out today
@BLKMDL3 Good idea
@BillyM2k @jack @gladstein @rahilla @farokh @samkazemian @TheSmarmyBum @ethereum That’s why I’m pro Doge
The @SkepticsGuide book is 👍
"Lots of Tesla cars to deliver before year end! Your support in taking delivery is much appreciated. 

Thanks also to the Tesla team working hard during the holidays!"
@scottwww @realrobcopeland Yeah, I didn’t have a house in the Bay Area for over a decade, despite spending half the week there
Whereas radar has trouble seeing small pedestrians, they’re obvious to Tesla vision https://t.co/ANUy58lgl7
@nurodev Disney restricted us to US only
@JeffTutorials Yes, but if we find unexpected bugs, release might be delayed until 24th
@WillFealey Yes
Tesla holiday software release being tested with internal owners today. Broader rollout starts tomorrow evening.
@WholeMarsBlog We’re aiming for a significant improvement for owners outside the US around March, depending on regulatory approvals
@Gfilche It’s a great whistle!
@BillyM2k @daelmor @DanCrenshawTX 💯
@WholeMarsBlog This assumes completion of the 10b sales
@cleantechnica Pure vision, especially when using explicit photon count, is much better than radar+vision, as the latter has too much ambiguity – when radar &amp; vision disagree, it is not clear which one to believe
@nichegamer 🤣
@teslatidbits @WholeMarsBlog @DanCrenshawTX A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
@daelmor @BillyM2k @DanCrenshawTX 🤣 People who don’t create products &amp; services don’t realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
@DanCrenshawTX Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected, but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?
@harald_murphy @SpaceX @Tesla @Jays200 A lot of improvement still coming just from software updates to satellites &amp; terminals

@lexfridman Yeah
I’m not suggesting web3 is real – seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now – just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic!

@BLKMDL3 Probably
"@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight Haha, this is not even its final form! Although, pretty close.

Tesla FSD 10.8 plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
@Space__Biscuit @NASASpaceflight 15 degrees
"@NASASpaceflight Yup. Next booster will have 33 Raptor 2 engines, with 13 steering. 

Ship is being upgraded to 9 engines (3 sea-level gimbaling, 6 vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load."
Each Raptor 1 engine above produces 185 metric tons of force. Raptor 2 just started production &amp; will do 230+ tons or over half a million pounds of force.

"@Teslarati @KlenderJoey Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD.

@cleantechnica It’s true
@SawyerMerritt @AustinTeslaClub Hell yeah
@PPathole @SpaceX @4thFromOurStar Sure hope so!
@Gfilche Physics ftw
@flcnhvy These are nice, but high time we built a really big Tesla coil!
@WholeMarsBlog Cells &amp; FSD are massive, the rest is just beauty &amp; romance … but life is empty without those last two
@shortword Yeah, headlights are precision LED, so they can be bright without blinding oncoming traffic, pedestrians &amp; cyclists
@truth_tesla It will hopefully achieve sustained cycle time of 45 seconds. At 75% uptime over an average week, that’s ~10k/week if run 24/7.
@teslaownersSV Sunday/Monday
@ErwinLindeman20 Das klingt nach “Space Party”
A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.

@GerberKawasaki Haha true
@johnkrausphotos Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem!
@lexfridman Sure
"@Teslarati @13ericralph31 It’s a big deal that Dragon is reusable, with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight! This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft.

It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made."
@probablyup Long list of mostly little items, but driving experience is significantly better. We will put notable changes in the release notes.
@jgrano305 Everyone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe 1100 to 1200 by Friday night.
@TeslaClubWI Note, quality of experience can vary dramatically, as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than others, but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions.
@TeslaClubWI Yes
@SahilBloom Try explaining it to a 17-month-old – that’s hard!
"FSD Beta 10.2 rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect 100/100 safety scores. 

Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes. 

If that looks good, beta will gradually begin rolling out to 99 scores &amp; below."

Probably next year before we get approval in New York."
@ElectricRaph @28delayslater @KounisTou Good point, we could enable visualization before control. Will enable that option hopefully next month.
@TeslaOwnersEBay @TeslaGong @inspiration4x Definitely upgraded toilets :) We had some challenges with it this flight.

@SpaceX ♥️ 🌍 🌎 🌏 ♥️
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @vincent13031925 Fully reusable rockets want high T/W to minimize $/ton to orbit, because propellant cost actually matters

@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Our new cell is 46mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
"@truth_tesla @LimitingThe Yes. 

Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.

Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.

Pretty basic."
Time is the ultimate currency
@long_elon @LimitingThe Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by 3:1 or more
@LimitingThe Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use.

@wapodavenport However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.
"@wapodavenport 16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights."

Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large."
@BBCAmos @NASASpaceflight Ok
"@WholeMarsBlog @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus:

Booster
- Grid fins for aero control
- Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Protecting engines from entry loads

Ship
- Body flaps for aero control
- Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks
- Heat shield"
@Astro_Elliott @NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Inevitably
@NASASpaceflight @BBCAmos Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.

@austinbarnard45 Indeed, there are some giant mosquitoes around here!
@DJSnM So many tubes …
@Erdayastronaut Raptor V2.0 is a major improvement in simplication, while also increasing thrust from ~185 tons to ~230 tons. Long-term goal is engine cost below $1000/ton of thrust.
@Erdayastronaut And that’s just the primary fuel lines! The maze of secondary plumbing &amp; wiring is our greatest concern.

"@DimaZeniuk @truth_tesla That’s a low bar. Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly, although VW is trying to change that.

@RationalEtienne @itsALLrisky Good thread
@stevenmarkryan @heydave7 @TeslaPodcast @MartinViecha Fair enough
@itsALLrisky And that’s just for Earth! Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.

"@skorusARK Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk. 

Like Model T, supply chain for battery EVs simply doesn’t exist at massive scale, so must be built in parallel.

Ideas are easy, production is hard."
"@Gfilche Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. 

I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft."
@DJSnM Indeed
@rich_teer @Tesla We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place.

@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure
@Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport.
"@PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!

Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.

Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done."
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal More of a pathfinder test. Actual payload bay door dimensions are still under debate. Volume is ~1000 cubic meters. Roomy …
@AustinTeslaClub @cleantechnica That’s the goal!
@WholeMarsBlog @karpathy The feeling is mutual. But I can’t emphasize enough that we work with an amazing team. The credit is theirs.

@MKBHD Also, the full self-driving interface renders across the whole display &amp; it is incredible. The yoke enables an unobstructed view of the screen.
"@MKBHD Good review &amp; fair critique.

@TeslaNY Do you even press?
@enn_nafnlaus @jpr007 @TesLatino @klwtts Indeed, but again like a parking lot, a battery having big “roads” tends to decrease number of “parking spaces” (ie stores less energy)

@FrenchieEAP @karpathy FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta 10 hopefully (Beta 11 definitely) will use one stack to rule them all – city streets, highway &amp; complex parking lots.
@Erdayastronaut @Model3Owners How about a wifi camera link?
"@BLKMDL3 @Model3Owners In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better.

No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door.

Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!"
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX @PortCanaveral Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.
"@Model3Owners To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. 

I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t. 

Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future."
"@TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”. 

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full."
"@jpr007 Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range.

@JxckSweeney @jack Good point
@ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX If we can do this successfully, then anything developed for ground/undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit
@ajtourville @PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Similar to fiber optic. We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function, but modified for use in vacuum.
@PPathole Yeah
@PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber
"@Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms."
"@jack 🙏 

A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great"
"@crheller @SpaceX Glad it’s working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing.

@austinbarnard45 Thanks Austin :)
@GokuAurelius @Erdayastronaut Roughly 800 to 1000 per year. That’s about what’s needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly 20 years, so hopefully it is built by ~2050.
@Erdayastronaut McGregor
@Erdayastronaut By “volume production”, I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. That’s super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards.

@DavidNagySFgang Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension, as with ship. Engines extend about 3m below booster.
@SmileSimplify @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius It’s one possibility
@RenataKonkoly @thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Kinda has to happen :)
"@thejackbeyer @MarcusHouse @artzius Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.

Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). 

Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe …"
@MarcusHouse @artzius All Raptors on booster, whether fixed or gimbaling, would be the same. 33*230 gets ~7600 tons of thrust &amp; T/W of ~1.5.
@Astro_Elliott @MarcusHouse @artzius Looking good at ~378 sec. Continued improvement will get it over 380.
Happy 4th to all!
Bless America https://t.co/QNagk4PArb
@MarcusHouse @artzius Current plan is to increase base Raptor thrust to ~230 tons or ~500 million lbs &amp; increase booster engine count to 32 or 33

@RenataKonkoly @thesheetztweetz @rookisaacman @johnkrausphotos @wapodavenport @blueorigin But can I pay in Doge?
@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition.
"@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDt

In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter."
@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL
"@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. 

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload."
@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R
Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S
"@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. 

In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V."

"@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it. 

However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing.

@dogeofficialceo @torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz Yeah, but dogz rūl
"@torybruno @ChadBowman0 @thesheetztweetz ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement. 

If this is not true, then you won’t have a problem removing it.

Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source. 

Seems a little inconsistent …"
@WholeMarsBlog Yeah
@thesheetztweetz Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero.
@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements
Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️
@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5.
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships.
@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower.
@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
@torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines … I mean, just in case.
@torybruno @Dynetics Sure
@PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie “Hollywood Dirt”!
"@nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too. 

That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July."
@torybruno @Dynetics When do the engines arrive? 😉
"@SpaceX Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic. 

There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken."
@SpaceX Sonic boom incoming https://t.co/jWAyA0j5Xx
"@IIHS_autosafety Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too.

@smvllstvrs Not bad
@DirtyTesla Production release update coming this week, which includes raising max speed to 80 mph. Sorry, 75 mph limit was done as precautionary measure. Turned out to be unnecessary.

"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.

@IlyaRosenberg @Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 They are now the same (LOX below CH4). Ox is 3.5 times heavier than fuel, so makes sense to have it lower.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time.

@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.
"@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc."
"Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. 

Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. 

Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp."
Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it.

@lexfridman @neuralink Yes
The device is implanted flush with skull &amp; charges wirelessly, so you look &amp; feel totally normal
@IheartTesla Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3.
Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again
First @Neuralink product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs

@_Jevis_ @PPathole Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal “glide” with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).
@PPathole Starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour.

Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
@OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!
@OwenSparks_ Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.

Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky."
"Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so! 

SpaceX’s hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly."
@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact."
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. 

Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days."
"@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today."

@TezlaMick @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Yes
"@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.

Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world."
@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
@PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it’s not a gamechanger.

"@business To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. 

However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere. 

Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is “almost”."
@business Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company.

@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we don’t fail, the cost to end users will improve every year.
@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.

@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they’re already there
@brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes
@josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky
@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land

@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

@flcnhvy Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.
So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. https://t.co/xCqTL5TGlE
@newscientist Um, we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance
@comma_ai Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can’t speak for regulators though.
@PPathole Dojo isn’t needed, but will make self-driving better. It isn’t enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers.

@PPathole @WSJ Absolutely
@Tesmanian_com Taste of the future
Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon.
@WSJ Focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future.
@ThatDesignGuy @m_siphiw @moosuraj @Tesla Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique — not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.
@LaurenRow5 @karpathy Yes
@engineers_feed Very important
@teslaownersSV @lexfridman Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check.
@teslaownersSV @lexfridman You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don’t have it?
@GUNMTLM3 @lexfridman No, but definitely this year
@lexfridman Good point
@conexionspacial @spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Interesting
@flcnhvy Liz has always done great interviews
@spacecoast_stve @NASASpaceflight Falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math?

@wintonARK During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.
"@wintonARK Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?"

@cleantechnica I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare
@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.
@Erdayastronaut @flightclubio Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
@picot_john @CyberpunkGame It’s a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
@truth_tesla @Tesmanian_com Perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.
@Tesmanian_com Dankeschön Brandenburg und Grünheide!
@Tesmanian_com Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world’s most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict.

@RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon
@MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.
@bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights
@nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.
@eugenelee3 @PPathole @karpathy Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.

@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15
@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
@thesheetztweetz But that’s why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
@thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance
Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.
@Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
@RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet
@StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it’s probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
@MarcusHouseGame Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip Yes
@PPathole @Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip We’re still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.
@Teslarati @TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.

@hisdirtremoves @SpaceX I can’t comment on turbopump internal details, but you’re roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
@TashaARK To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.

@ReflexFunds @nickidk4 @pcgamer Dojo/Doge
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it’s mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly
"@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. 

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen."
@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!
@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn’t matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.
@flcnhvy @LUGG4S1 @pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.

@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don’t blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain.
@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn’t work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.

@flcnhvy Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other
Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety https://t.co/KrOHKOr6AE
@KlotzAdam @PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. I’ve had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over.
@PPathole @AstroJordy @erujabidi Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.
@PPathole @Mario_Livio Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument
Astronaut launch today! https://t.co/3FAzZGss8c
@Mario_Livio No kids though
@Mario_Livio Hell of a wig collection too
@michaelmina_lab It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
Worth reading this thread if you’re curious about rona testing https://t.co/FA6kD61eBA
@stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it’s high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes “positive”.
@AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
@michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I’m asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
@teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
@erujabidi Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold.

@robintosh_nunez @PPathole Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of today’s test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.
@ICannot_Enough @JohnnaCrider1 What’s honey?

@MrSammy_H @pelagicbird @max_roi @rossy65 Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford 🤣🤣. General public doesn’t realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
@WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
@MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.
Case closed https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6
Soon https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk
@PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable.
@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
@PPathole Strange
@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.

@dana_e_morgan Sure is
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What’s the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
@ClareCraigPath Interesting
@john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
"@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. 

False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo"
@justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
@cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
The carousel turns ever faster
@JoeInGeneral @andrewbogut Yup
@ajtourville Exactly
@JaneidyEve Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
@BLKMDL3 If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
@austinbarnard45 Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We’ll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SpacePadreIsle @austinbarnard45 Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
@austinbarnard45 We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it’s going to pop the cork.

@reganlovetesla @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc Enough already on my plate &amp; Tesla’s. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100X harder.

@flcnhvy @PPathole @cleantechnica We rewrote all labeling software for 4D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo won’t contribute for about a year. It’s mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark we’re tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or it’s pointless.
@PPathole @cleantechnica Version 1 is about a year away

@ICannot_Enough @ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Yes, although I didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they’re needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
@FutureJurvetson @PPathole Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
@ZainRaz4 @vincent13031925 @JonErlichman Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
@vincent13031925 @JonErlichman I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
@JonErlichman That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn’t own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.
@josh_bickett @PPathole Yes
@PPathole Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge
@itshamzahkhan As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year.
@thesheetztweetz Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!
@kjell_arne @flcnhvy Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
@enn_nafnlaus @flcnhvy Didn’t realize that was possible. No problem if there’s a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
@flcnhvy As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
@LouisWFerreira New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.

@FNarolles @TGMetsFan98 This is what matters most
@Erdayastronaut @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight We’ve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
@flcnhvy @RGVaerialphotos https://t.co/HEz9otgJJH
@RGVaerialphotos Lord of the …
@TGMetsFan98 @KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Minor
@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
@NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @TesLatino Every 5 to 10 days
@Kristennetten @teslaownersSV @TesLatino Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
@teslaownersSV @TesLatino We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
"@TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! 

Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. Reality is the hardest sim."

@flcnhvy All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
@flcnhvy And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.

@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Sure
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ I’m in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
@austinbarnard45 @SuperclusterHQ Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
@WholeMarsBlog Yup. With beta updates, there’ll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
@bart_sanders Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
@SpacePadreIsle Starship is coming together!
Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
@austinbarnard45 There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
@DMC_Ryan Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?
@StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires?
@SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
@flcnhvy Sure
Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
@TeslaGong @PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road!

@PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Yes
@teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Haha
@Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety
@WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).

@Erdayastronaut Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn’t achieve anything, but I’m confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
"@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. 

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps."
FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.

@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
@Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it’s right.
@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you, much more accurate haha
@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down
@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan
@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.
@shortword @jwangARK The SoC’s sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it’s fairly obvious when one is discordant
@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.

@MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JeffBezos @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don’t count!
@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.
@flcnhvy Definitely
@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.
@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all.
@Carrenimfa Interesting

@Erdayastronaut I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
@RationalEtienne @toadmeister Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.

Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I’ve posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I’ve posted doesn’t need to reverse engineer!
@Teslarati Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
@flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
@Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
@ID_AA_Carmack Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.

"@TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. 

It’s already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive."
@RenataKonkoly @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD.
@EVHQ2 @TashaARK It should be
@franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close — a tantalizing local maximum — but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
@PicklePunchD @PPathole @TashaARK Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 🤣
@ZainRaz4 @PPathole @TashaARK Yes
@PPathole @TashaARK Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
@TashaARK Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
@akidesir @Kristennetten Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
@ErcXspace @SpaceX @Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster.

@TribeHoh @SpaceX @WAStateCommerce You’re most welcome!
@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
@alex_avoigt @mike_zimon @WholeMarsBlog That looks tasty!
@tesladri @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog Sandy Munro understands engineering
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
@WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
"@WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. 

Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."
@AstroJordy @WholeMarsBlog They are
@WholeMarsBlog I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
@PPathole @klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley 7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. We’ll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest.
@klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking
@Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley One of the best shots ever!
@SamTalksTesla @SpaceX Much sooner
@mdcainjr @SpaceX @45thSpaceWing @NASA Great photo!
@DirtyTesla @SpaceX It will soon
@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
@alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.
4th flight &amp; landing for this booster https://t.co/UOtvMkgXqH
5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far. https://t.co/on2f1pY5jt
@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car’s exhaust pipe.
@SciGuySpace It’s a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.

@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
@RationalEtienne @SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
@SPEXcast @William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Great
@William_M_Brown @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity — needs several more Starlink launches. I’m using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
@PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we’re able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
@RationalEtienne @PPathole @thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn’t required for Mars, so 4 is possible
@thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
@WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Yeah
@AdlanBogatyryov @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we’re actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.
@MKBHD It’s next-level

@ErcXspace @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
@Model3Owners @FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT That’s very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? It’s designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
@FutureJurvetson @CFS_energy @CUP_Plasma @MIT It’s cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)

@vm_one1 @waEMD @SpaceX We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.
@PerezShivam @waEMD @SpaceX Fate loooves irony haha
@waEMD @SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
@austinbarnard45 True
@teslavibes That’s total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution.
@CashMoneyLemon @CathieDWood @skorusARK Total market
@CathieDWood @skorusARK Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.
@flcnhvy @CathieDWood Both will do original cars
@CathieDWood We aren’t cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
@brian_heide @Tesla What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?
@Pickenheim @matthew_kerle New version coming soon
@WholeMarsBlog Suppliers. We’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard.

@Kristennetten Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool
@ID_AA_Carmack Completely agree
@Erdayastronaut Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.
Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
@ScottAdamsSays There are times when I feel like I’m living in a Dilbert cartoon
@ArtifactsHub That species has stood the test of time
@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, we’re making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.
@NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It’s enough. Improvements in work.
@PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach.
First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut There are some practical size constraints too. Can’t be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut Doesn’t seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.

@teslaownersSV cgi irl
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @CARandDRIVER @Tesla Haha
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Haha
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
@EvaFoxU Thanks!
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship. They’re coming.
@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.
@Model3Owners Fine, we’ll do it already 😀
@ARKInvest @TashaARK Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature

@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
@samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
@llamaa35079089 @ID_AA_Carmack @Tesla You really want waypoints this much?
@ID_AA_Carmack For Dojo, we’re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.

@ValaAfshar Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for New York or Beijing.
@MatthewCable6 @ErcXspace Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We’ll build several ships just to improve the production system.
@ErcXspace Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration.
@teslavibes Couldn’t agree more — major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming
@cleantechnica Definitely not. Smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterday’s technology, Neuralinks are the future.

@PPathole @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Cumulative mass to orbit per year (corrected for GTO &amp; other high energy orbits) is the best comparative metric imo
@PPathole @_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX That’s the number that really matters
@_rykllan @FelixSchlang @spaceXcentric @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles?
One way or another, excitement guaranteed! Support of greater Boca, Padre, Brownsville community is very much appreciated.
SN8 Starship with flaps &amp; nosecone should be done in about a week. Then static fire, checkouts, static fire, fly to 60,000 ft &amp; back.
@SpacePadreIsle @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Can someone do a boat service from South Padre to Boca?
@WhatsupFranks @samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
@PPathole @WholeMarsBlog Yes. Good insight.
@samiralyateem @WholeMarsBlog All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) &amp; then creating video segments for labeling &amp; training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten.
@WhatsupFranks @brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Much
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes
@brandonbernicky @WholeMarsBlog Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks.
@WholeMarsBlog And this still isn’t using the dramatically better “4D” (aka simultaneous surround video from 8 cameras) architecture
@C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @MarcusHouseGame Cool

@Teslarati Rawlinson didn’t design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined &amp; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough, which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @SpaceX We’re pretty close to the manufacturing size limit for a milled copper &amp; steel jacket nozzle. Lot of complexity to add a nozzle extension to a sea level engine for small gain. Also hard to fit bigger engine nozzles on the booster.

@PPathole @SpaceX This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal.
@SpaceX Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.

@l_vaux @kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.
@PPathole @kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I’m headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.
@tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells https://t.co/z9WlvIjoTw
@PPathole @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Yeah
@kulpability @tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.
@tlowdon @EthicalSkeptic Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.

@OwenSparks_ @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci No
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.
@Erdayastronaut @dauqhx @universal_sci Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That’s probably faster.
@waitbutwhy Now I want candy
@dauqhx @universal_sci There’s a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It’s solvable.
@universal_sci Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
@jchybow @jwangARK @wintonARK It’s almost working reliably
@jwangARK @wintonARK Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
@jwangARK @wintonARK Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
@tesla_addicted @Erdayastronaut No &amp; not possible at this scale
@Erdayastronaut Orbital launch mount
@NASASpaceflight Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.
@schristakos @skorusARK Sure
@shortword On it

@DanielleFong @ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Absolutely needs liquid cooling. We’re applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
@TeslaTested That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight We will push for ten flights with Starlink
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
@Erdayastronaut @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Mostly for employees, but we’ll support public access whenever it’s safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 Absolutely 😃 🏝
@Erdayastronaut @nextspaceflight I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
@cnunezimages @SpaceIntellige3 I’ve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
@ajtourville @comma_ai @Tesmanian_com Dojo V1.0 isn’t done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
@spacecoast_stve Scorcher VI https://t.co/34O80p1hI6
@antonioetayo @Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Yes
@Erdayastronaut @C_Bass3d @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
@nextspaceflight Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you’re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3
@zubinanary @SpaceIntellige3 @guidodecaso @cnunezimages Yes, it will have huge nuts haha
@Teslarati We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!

@Erdayastronaut @ProgrammerDude Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.
@AdamBlitzer @levie 💨
@justpaulinelol @NASASpaceflight That’s engine SN. We’re building SN8 of the ship.
@NASASpaceflight SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! https://t.co/kVKRWksvaB
@Erdayastronaut Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights.
@C_Bass3d @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @FelixSchlang Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.

@pantsbobsponge @andyjstanton @TimFernholz You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.

@TimFernholz Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd …
@Tesmanian_com I generally try my best not to be on patents
@TimFernholz Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; “space power”. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money.
@WholeMarsBlog Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails.
@renarddemoscou @BillGates Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
@Teslarati No surprise
@Teslarati Aiming to make it super fun!
@Teslarati A little toastier each flight
@flcnhvy Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending.
SN7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. SN8 will have body flaps &amp; nosecone.

@Erdayastronaut Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg &amp; other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple &amp; easy — many per day.
@lexfridman Clearly
@ramacvr @Kristennetten @PPathole @BernieSanders Also true
@Kristennetten @PPathole @BernieSanders 🤣🤣
@PPathole @BernieSanders Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3.
@RationalEtienne @BernieSanders I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
@BernieSanders And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when we’re doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news? https://t.co/34tzBk5TIv
@BernieSanders That bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil! https://t.co/WmzJnoTFzI
@Siconik1 @WR4NYGov @28delayslater @BernieSanders 🎯
@WR4NYGov @BernieSanders Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies.
@westcoastbill 💯
@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height.
@Erdayastronaut @queue_max @NASASpaceflight I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
@NASASpaceflight It will look crazy tall with booster &amp; fairing at 122m / 394 ft
@RenataKonkoly @TimothyBuffett @Teslarati @JaneidyEve Ok

@PPathole @TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica We’ll do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps
@ebelardo73 @bluemoondance74 @TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica Soon
@TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller — like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling.
@flcnhvy Progress is accelerating
@SciGuySpace Exactly
@austinbarnard45 Mars is looking real
@TrevorMahlmann Possible flight in 3 mins
@Erdayastronaut Most likely
@flcnhvy @Lindw0rm @cleantechnica True
@Lindw0rm @cleantechnica Highly likely down the road
@cleantechnica True fact
@NASASpaceflight Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didn’t open, triggering an automatic abort. We’ll figure out why &amp; retry tomorrow.
@Erdayastronaut I’m in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.

Astronauts land in 2 hours @NASA @SpaceX
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes.

@flcnhvy @shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains &amp; functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but won’t make up for loss of the Link.
@shravantr @Neuro_Skeptic Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups &amp; restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device.
@Neuro_Skeptic Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix.
@Neuro_Skeptic They don’t fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.

@stevenbonchev @APompliano Something like that. If politicians could legislate wealth, everyone would be a trillionaire.
These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers.
@PPathole Pretty much
Goal of government should be to maximize the happiness of the people. Giving each person money allows them to decide what meets their needs, rather than the blunt tool of legislation, which creates self-serving special interests.
As a reminder, I’m in *favor* of universal basic income
Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo

@vicentes @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
@jgrano305 @TeslaratiTeam @Teslarati No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)

@blue_bnd @Kristennetten @flcnhvy @PPathole Yeah, it’s pretty weird
@spaceguy_24 @teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU @cnunezimages @Tesla Yeah, but first we need to finish Giga Berlin and a second US Giga to serve eastern half of North America
@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages Nice haha

Please take a moment to report accounts clearly engaged in harassment. It is the only way to maintain public discourse.
🇺🇸🇺🇸 Happy 4th of July!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
@PPathole @cybrtrkguy @flcnhvy That would be great
@xiang_aw @bigwheelastro @ChainsawMelee @EvaFoxU @PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley Agreed, but it’s hard to ignore what is effectively a social media denial of service attack
@cybrtrkguy @flcnhvy Accounts that unequivocally advocate harassment should be suspended with warning, then shut down if repeated
@flcnhvy True
@bigwheelastro @ChainsawMelee @EvaFoxU @PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley Yeah, but why? I’m working on sustainable energy cars &amp; solar that help Earth and making life multiplanetary, to ensure its continuance, with SpaceX.
@EvaFoxU @PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley Thanks, that would promote good public discourse
@PPathole @leighalexander @TalulahRiley A pseudojourno asked all his followers to spam my mentions
@UniverCurious Wow
@Martx1995 @leighalexander True
@leighalexander You’re a good person
@leighalexander @SpaceX To the best our knowledge, he never toured SpaceX. Don’t know where that comes from.
@leighalexander I was at that Vanity Fair party with @TalulahRiley. Don’t know Ghislaine. Real question is why did VF invite her?
@kenklippenstein Now you’re unblocked, so stop whining
@kenklippenstein I only block people as a direct insult https://t.co/KWW9GCvQGb
@PPathole @SamTalksTesla Yes. Green card (permanent residency) is fine too for SpaceX, according to ITAR rules.
@HassanAesthetic Yeah, Tesla app would enable you to release your car into the fleet &amp; summon it back at will
@SamTalksTesla Directly, my companies employ roughly 65,000 people. However, there is a massive global supply &amp; logistics chain that employs 4 to 5 times that number.

@EverydayElon @TeslaTested @teslaownersSV @kimbal HCL appears to be effective when used early https://t.co/d27STax48L
@Lockl34r @Tesla Unfortunately, there are thousands of automotive design rule differences between US &amp; EU, including completely different charge ports. Gets worse every year. Not our choice.
@TeslaTested @teslaownersSV @kimbal There’s that too. Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of.
@teslaownersSV @kimbal Deaths continue to trend down https://t.co/FsZNwkvs1H
@kimbal We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives.
@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Yes
@flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.
@flcnhvy @RationalEtienne @chrish7985 @rlyrlysryDave Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll. Big mistake. Never go full troll!

@PPathole @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 Yup
@hot_rod_co Something’s messed up about medicine that’s anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts &amp; reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people who’ve accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one.

@WilliamShatner @VitalikButerin @ethereum @mattereum I’m not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just don’t use it or own any.
@truth_tesla @bipulh Lithium is common. Hard part is turning lithium salt or clay into extremely pure LiOH.
@Kristennetten @SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 Yes, at Tesla Grohmann
@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others
@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.
@tlowdon @daniellevitt22 As you’d expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.
@EthicalSkeptic Seems fishy
@Louisbotelho17 @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory 🤣🤣 very true
@TeslaOwnersEBay @WholeMarsBlog @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely, it will be releasable in 2 to 4 months. Then it’s a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners.
@WholeMarsBlog @romanhistory1 @HardcoreHistory Going well. Team is kicking ass &amp; it’s an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten, including our labeling software, so that it’s fundamentally “3D” at every step from training through inference.

@PicklePunchD @RenataKonkoly @bipulh You just have to be a shareholder. There is limited space, so sign up fast when we do final confirmation of date &amp; location.
@GovStitt @Tesla Wow, I’ve never seen this level of support! Out of respect, seems like I should at least visit.
@RenataKonkoly @bipulh We need to finish building a much longer vacuum tunnel for speed tests &amp; probably have an additional competition for tunneling itself

@kyle_papili Fixing
@RationalEtienne @TimothyBuffett @WhatsupFranks @kimbal Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? It’s almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano.
Your GPS just got slightly better https://t.co/XsblUsiNXU
@justin_hart @BrittMayJasper This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
@CosmicNinjaGoat @WhatsupFranks @kimbal If accurate, this would explain a lot
@WhatsupFranks @kimbal Levitt is right
@kimbal There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.
@BerniceKing @jack @MichaelDTubbs @AndrewYang Very much agree
@28delayslater @geekwire Good hygiene always makes sense
@ChrisDungeon True
@Garrett_Watts @_TomCross_ @Tesla @Petersen_Museum Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
@geekwire https://t.co/mLh6baqfeT
@geekwire There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.
Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla.

@lulusdave @Tesla Glad you’re ok
@flcnhvy @Ford Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality &amp; market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert &gt;80% of the global road, sea &amp; air fleet to renewables by 2050.

@TslaCybertruck @jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD
@jgrano305 @uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?
@uhaveanygrapes @Flash_Titans This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
@Flash_Titans Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure.
@TheGledinator @teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Haha Teslas all the way down
@teslaownersSV @mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla Maybe, will look into it. We’d need to emulate a TV.
@mattie_rogers @aikatchu @Tesla We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas
@MKBHD Bought based on your review. It’s great!
@cleantechnica The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness &amp; rate of progress in the absolute
@cleantechnica For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do
@cleantechnica Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies
@vincent13031925 @teslacn We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
@aikatchu @Tesla Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet
@flcnhvy Feels so long ago
@PPathole @Tesla Pulling up to The Petersen
@ArtifactsHub @engineeringvids Nice
@DanielleFong @PPathole We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
@CoreyBa95130768 @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut It will look a little odd
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @cleantechnica Probably Fremont
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @cleantechnica Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week.
@Kristennetten @cleantechnica Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later.
@cleantechnica Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
@PPathole It does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays

@NYYScoreKeep Not sure. They’re pretty close together.
@westcoastbill It will be real
@cisoml @Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish Maybe Incat https://t.co/qHbJcMocFg
@flcnhvy There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
@Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
@YarLP Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system &amp; doesn’t come back &amp; land

China &amp; Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind. https://t.co/Em23E2AFyO
@VitalVegas Looking likely
@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
@SciGuySpace Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SciGuySpace Yes
@SciGuySpace That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.

@engineers_feed Stonks
lol
@Erdayastronaut @i_gvf @SciGuySpace Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @physorg_com @nature @SciReports True
@olenamuliarchuk @mrkylefield @cleantechnica Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great.

@nickwijngaards @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it’s 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration …
@John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I’d call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast https://t.co/axmInA9fZb
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.
After which they are recycled https://t.co/xuu1ohdz52
Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km https://t.co/z882nf6yv9
Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories https://t.co/IDqf5gWeFt
Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount https://t.co/tsk9TXgW67

Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets https://t.co/4lyaV7kIS4
@venus47203379 @engineers_feed Haha. Will post summary.
@SciGuySpace Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
@SciGuySpace Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80’s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.

@chriswarriner @flcnhvy Bad incentive structure
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut We’re working on new legs. Wider stance &amp; able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky &amp; pitted surfaces.
@Erdayastronaut Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.
@Erdayastronaut Absolutely
@JimBridenstine @Commercial_Crew @NASA Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.
@Lance210 🤣
@PPathole @Tesla Autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential.

@PPathole That’s when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took 4.5 billion years to get to this point &amp; civilization isn’t looking super stable.
@SciGuySpace So many war stories over 18 eventful years! But Starship can make life multiplanetary, which is what really matters for safeguarding the light of consciousness &amp; life as we know it. 100X improvement over Falcon/Dragon.

@EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.
@SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.
@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.
@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!

@thirdrowtesla @mayemusk Ok
@mayemusk !
@sspencer_smb @flcnhvy It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
@flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.
@raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.

@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator
@Johnnaaaaaaaaaa @EvaFoxU @Tesla Sure :)
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Way more important than it sounds
@GavinNewsom Yeah!!
@Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
@Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight SLS makes me feel sad

@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.
@Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid
@Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! https://t.co/WF9AGgee12

@BocachicaMaria1 Thanks Maria 💕
@AndEstrino Possibly even flatter!
@bluemoondance74 @mycroft16 @LabPadre @SpaceX Hopefully so
What’s wild is that Super Heavy will have 31 Raptor engines in same space!
@AndEstrino It’s true, the pressure bulkheads are too pointy
Starship SN4 passed static fire
@Gaelic_Neilson Happy, healthy &amp; cute as a button :)
@MyGrindelwald @LauraBockov @subeiwoo @JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?
@LauraBockov @subeiwoo @JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson There would be time-stamped video if this were true
@JimBridenstine @TomCruise @Space_Station @NASA Should be a lot of fun!
@Gfilche @Tesla There are many pieces to the puzzle
@enn_nafnlaus @tmornini @bouncygulag @Param86330798 @Grimezsz DKE in a nutshell: we’re almost always dumber than we think we are
@WhatsupFranks @alexmd2 @slashdot @NYGovCuomo That would be awesome
@subeiwoo @JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson This is false. JD’s team put out “video evidence”, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated.
@teslaownersSV @slashdot Yeah, definitely a future feature
@martinvars @GavinNewsom Levitt rocks
@slashdot Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms.
@JoshSchoen @AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson Utter moron
@AlexBerenson @neil_ferguson Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake “science”.

@cleantechnica Anyway, we’re just talking about 2% here, so not much. Confident Model S will get 400+ miles as soon as retest is allowed.
@cleantechnica Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace I hope anything lands
@NASASpaceflight @TesLatino @Erdayastronaut It seems unlikely right now
@TesLatino @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.
@NASASpaceflight Thanks!

Well said, Lord Sumption, well said! https://t.co/cfCVEaZ5cM
@thirdrowtesla Ok, we will
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Kristennetten Yes, about a month away from testing Raptor Vacuum
@Kristennetten A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton.
Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
Minecraft has amazing legs
That was 2.5 years ago &amp; still not even on the moon. Progress must accelerate!
@cleantechnica Pretty much

@brendan2908 @flcnhvy @HarryStoltz1 @JaneidyEve Yes
@flcnhvy @HarryStoltz1 @JaneidyEve Just one. SN5 will get three.

@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yes, switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes.
@kulpability @NASASpaceflight Successive iteration of both design &amp; manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
@NASASpaceflight It’s a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!

@harsha_irugu 👍 🤣
@CBSNewYork @AielloTV Heard same from doc I trust
@yourfavgas @justpaulinelol No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad
@justpaulinelol That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
So often true 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qxmDtZ4Buf
@brendan2908 @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
@PPathole Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
@jh_csquared @AlexBrendel2 @Erdayastronaut As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it
@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It’s also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard
@PPathole Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
@jgrano305 @thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Progress is good
@thirdrowtesla @cleantechnica Definitely
@cleantechnica Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation.
@DMC_Ryan @RenataKonkoly Sure, we can probably do an update later this year
@Kristennetten @PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Needs to be more than halfway to east coast
@PPathole @alexanderbittan @shelbiestrykers Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity

@jgrano305 @teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
@teslaownersSV @TOGregTO Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing.
@TOGregTO That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil &amp; gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy.

@skorusARK Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothing’s as weird as reality!
@TesLatino @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker @SpaceX It’s made of a special dark foam that’s extremely radio transparent, so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now.
@OwenSparks_ @flcnhvy @anime_virus @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Yes
@yourfavgas @julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg &amp; ignited in flight
@julia_bergeron @NASASpaceflight Sure hope so!
@TOGregTO Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so
@TOGregTO Not the greatest use of money
@anime_virus @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @MFrunker If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites …
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
@thirdrowtesla @MFrunker Makes sense
@nichegamer Nice
@jgrano305 @PPathole @Supernova_Style Anything surprising?
@PPathole @Supernova_Style Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
@Supernova_Style No kidding …
@ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Good article

@Erdayastronaut @teslaownersSV @NASA SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing &amp; now docking with @Space_Station, which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves &amp; will be uncrewed at first.
@RationalEtienne @teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Great platform 🤣🤣
@Johnny_Detroit @WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy !!
@teslaownersSV @Erdayastronaut Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars
@Peter_J_Beck @thesheetztweetz @ulalaunch @torybruno @SpaceX 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
@Erdayastronaut I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind.
@WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter.
@InSpaceXItrust @jgrano305 Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
@jgrano305 Probably 3 to 6 months
@flcnhvy Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points https://t.co/5cPQ29wOvu
"@flcnhvy You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.

@bluemoondance74 @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
@bluemoondance74 @MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster SN5
@MichaelCanary02 @Erdayastronaut @dwesterster No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry

“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo https://t.co/LtpsVqoZVf
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
@flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg
@dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?

@RationalEtienne @PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.

It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
@PPathole @fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla My (again) personal favorite is https://t.co/rM1MqsVsr1
@sivanithu @tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee @RocketLab Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
"@fat__tire @Kristennetten @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2.

@tobyliiiiiiiiii @cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee SN26
@cabral_psyd @sivanithu @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!
@PPathole @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
@Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg
@Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.
@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
@thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.
@SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.
To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
@brandonbernicky You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
@justpaulinelol There’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!
Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature
@thirdrowtesla This will happen
@PPathole @thirdrowtesla We stole that from cheetahs
@thirdrowtesla In case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs
@Sofiaan @thirdrowtesla There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A.

@katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace @Rogozin In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.
@Darkellysio @katlinegrey @Zvezdichko @SciGuySpace The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: https://t.co/Aq81q9oMdq

@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
@PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.

@SciGuySpace SN3 passed ambient temperature pressure test last night, now doing cryogenic
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who’s behind it.
@flcnhvy @28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.
@NuovaRealta @cleantechnica Will call when we reach Mars
@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Exactly
@pinkshotgun1 @kimitalvitie Definitely need a wider span

@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!

@RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly
@jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.

@uwdrwaldorf @Tesla @omead_a @UWMedicine Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
@justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
@EvaFoxU @Tesla Supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
@NativeCACV @Tesla @omead_a You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
@benikbeno @CDCgov Panic is always dumb
@Guruleaks1 @benikbeno Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”
@CDCgov Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
@Jennerator211 We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :)
@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
@Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :)
@RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive
@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
@NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”. https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@friedberg Feels like the plot of Deus Ex https://t.co/R8tmw048JM
@MG42bonesaw A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
@RenataKonkoly @moskov Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too
@moskov That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can’t stay open
@EdLudlow Yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won’t be needed
@alandrummond2 Interesting thread
@DOfaquarius @PPathole Thanks 💖
@Cernovich China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
@DOfaquarius @PPathole We’re working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
@flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.
@RationalEtienne @PPathole https://t.co/eltgA3hrAr
@RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
@PPathole Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
@PPathole Yes
No new domestic corona cases in China https://t.co/lGmxRvMyFy
@westcoastbill Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG
@NYCMayor @NateSilver538 Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
@M_Mosseri @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_Astronauts Yes
@DisruptResearch @Jason True
@Jason Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already.
@suhaylabbas @fawadchaudhry We will make ventilators if there is a shortage

@SciGuySpace Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.

@RenataKonkoly @meckimac I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts &amp; sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt …
@meckimac Was also given a lot of doxycycline https://t.co/hn0BzsIatz
@Gundament Maybe helpful
@meckimac Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn’t mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing.
Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 https://t.co/LEYob7Jofr

@PPathole @FxzzOnTheBeat Ships with a lot of people &amp; limited medical facilities are a serious issue
@lexfridman Yeah, that’s a great one
@FxzzOnTheBeat Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!
@FxzzOnTheBeat Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!
@War_Remains @HardcoreHistory Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.

@Erdayastronaut @Sofiaan @Tesla Cool, we’re tracking to release more FSD features later this month
@Sofiaan @Tesla True. Oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery.
Mad respect for the makers of things
@Teslarati No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated.

@RationalEtienne @Bryr32 Full disclosure, I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @Teslarati Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact
@Erdayastronaut @Teslarati It’s slightly better
@nichegamer Definitely worth trying imo
@Teslarati Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
@Teslarati Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far https://t.co/Ky65Q3s3JX
🔭 https://t.co/6HHgR0ZVp0
@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
@PPathole @JohnHanzl It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
@JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
@JohnHanzl LOX
@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
@flcnhvy @sydney_ev Probably

@RationalEtienne I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done! https://t.co/G9h0430ns2
@pentaquarky @Erdayastronaut The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.

@BLKMDL3 @jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason X will also improve by a similar amount
@jgrano305 @BLKMDL3 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 &amp; 390
@jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan @Jason Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +
@DMC_Ryan @Jason There’s a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.
@PPathole Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
@PPathole Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.

The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours.
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home
@dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year
@TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
@_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
@_mantis_ Ok
@G_d_Photographr Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.

@JaneidyEve You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume.
@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

@reto_siegrist @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla Yes
🔥🔥🔥
@CathieDWood @sbarnettARK @jwangARK @ARKInvest First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
@TeslaGong @indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I’m unaware of
@indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
@TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.
@DOfaquarius @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It’s *awesome*.
@ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Probably this summer
@ajtourville @CathieDWood @ARKInvest Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.
@PPathole PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.
@CathieDWood @ARKInvest The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
@TheReal_Psyche Sorry!
@SamTalksTesla A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
@John_Gardi Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency
Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin
Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.
Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with

@Astronomiaum Only 66 years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. Now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. This must change.
@marialauraadr @justpaulinelol @nichegamer Haha true
@nichegamer @justpaulinelol The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!
@nichegamer @justpaulinelol Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren’t being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, they’re just several clicks away.
@justpaulinelol @nichegamer This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things https://t.co/qSfqTpfzb2
@justpaulinelol @nichegamer Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.
@nichegamer The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool.

@georgezachary There is considerable conflation of diagnosis &amp; contraction of “corona”. Actual virality is much lower than it would seem. I think this will turn out to be comparable to other forms of influenza. World War Z it is not.

@Erdayastronaut @Blamblas @latimes @SpaceX @blueorigin Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel.

@mstrwilliam00 @Erdayastronaut Aiming for 20 to 30 years, like aircraft
@Kristennetten @PicklePunchD @Erdayastronaut Yes. There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!
@PicklePunchD @Erdayastronaut Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who don’t have money
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
@PRANSHUAGARWA13 @Erdayastronaut Yes
@Erdayastronaut That’s the goal
@Erdayastronaut Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
@Erdayastronaut Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit
Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
@fighteer1 @LCS_Big_Mike @SciGuySpace That’s about right
@g33st111 Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.
@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
@SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy.
@SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!
@Teslarati Sorry, migh have brought the site down

@nntaleb Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically &amp; certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
@ErlendMoberget @ramez @KHayhoe Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun.
@Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant 🔭 in orbit &amp; on moon. With an occluder, could image 🌏 in other star systems.
@Neuro_Skeptic One person’s MRI machine is another’s railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
@Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Exactly. We’ve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, we’ll make sure Starlink doesn’t inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky.

@ramez @KHayhoe Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area that’s *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!

@d1rtydan Haha
We are trapped in a prison of fonts
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Yes
@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.

@cleantechnica The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil.
@Erdayastronaut Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!

@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?
@Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
@Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qTN2TU02pb

@realRickyReeves @Erdayastronaut @NASA Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.
@kulpability @NASA New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there

@ingmutw @iam_preethi @Tesla Ok

@vincent13031925 @boringcompany Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.
@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
@ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much
@Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.
@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.
@EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.

@cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.
@Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books.

@waitbutwhy @Kurz_Gesagt Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too.

Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
@Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
@JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
@mobiledavidd We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
@Erdayastronaut Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
@Erdayastronaut Most people still don’t know it’s there
Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar
@TesLatino @teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?
"@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins Merry Christmas 🎄🎁😀
Hope you’re enjoying latest software update!"
@jamescharles Yer welcome son
@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled).
@jamescharles That is odd. Try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. Have forwarded this to service.
@teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins No

@youfoundalec @EV_Stevee @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Yes
@teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Regarding 2.X to 3 hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then.
@EV_Stevee @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, I’d love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers.
@flcnhvy @cgpgrey @thirdrowtesla Ok sure
@EV_Stevee @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldn’t get it all done in time.
@marialauraadr @teslaownersSV @cgpgrey Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever
@cgpgrey My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least it’s obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is 🤣🤣
@RenataKonkoly Yes 🤣♥️
@TechnologicAli Started Zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I don’t put in mine.
If Tesla &amp; SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be.
Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. It’s insane! Btw, can someone please delete “investor”. I do basically zero investing.

@master_ov @tesletter @teslaownersSV Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars &amp; is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors &amp; antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough.
@tesletter @teslaownersSV I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
@teslaownersSV MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isn’t needed for full self-driving &amp; cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it

@_mkavin_ @mayemusk That’s the one!
@Jason @mayemusk It really does
@RenataKonkoly @mayemusk They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
@v_g_fischer @mayemusk Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
@mayemusk Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.

@NCBirbhan @Erdayastronaut Yeah, it’s one of my favorite T-shirts!
@teslaownersSV We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
@Kristennetten Your Twitter comments are great btw!
@Kristennetten This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs
@Real_John_D @Teslarati @tesla_raj There will be no loss of either
@flcnhvy @Teslarati @tesla_raj That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

@vistacruiser7 @RenataKonkoly Interesting idea
@evanthefreeman @CoinstorageGuru True
@RenataKonkoly 🤣🤣
@Erdayastronaut Really? Ok sure.
@vicentes Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
@vicentes Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️ https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI
@annerajb @flcnhvy We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods.
@flcnhvy Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press

@RobGMacfarlane @nybooks @emilyraboteau Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
@zerohedge 😘 https://t.co/w0BkNGbvQ1
@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
@uhaveanygrapes @Teslarati Looking into it
@Ryanth3nerd @Teslarati Yes
@FredericLambert @Teslarati The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
@flcnhvy Great poem
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. https://t.co/Q814zVoW4S
@Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!
"Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃 
Happy Halloween!! https://t.co/p5tXeJYqne"
@stephenpallotta @Teslarati Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong
@Teslarati Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.

@Jason @kylegrantham Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
@Jon4Lakers @Tesla We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc
@kylegrantham Very true. Glass doesn’t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
@realDiegoMonroy I hate advertising
Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot

Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
@jasondunn So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. 
https://t.co/3y4M5L50qF"
@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
@starshipsara Extremely high
@teslaownersSV Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time

@HarryStoltz1 That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!
Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!
@TeslaNY @SpaceX Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly.
🔥
@longnow @Liv_Boeree Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth.
To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9

@Erdayastronaut @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well.

@Teslarati The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track
Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
@Erdayastronaut Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …
@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
@RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020
@NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
@TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer
@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq
@torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
@teslaownersSV @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces.
@Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!
@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
@NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …

Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
@brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …
@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
@wilsonlam 😉
@annerajb @Thebault_Arthur Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.

@The_ShadowZone @DJSnM For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating

@Erdayastronaut @CptnCrutch5373 @Kalzsom Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver.
@happych19952208 😉
@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg.
@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3
@SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
@SpaceXFan97 Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out.

@cleantechnica srsly
@vincent13031925 @ResidentSponge @Teslarati It’s my 🔥 glasses 😉
@Robotbeat @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term.
@TeslaTested @Teslarati Next quarter
@TeslaTested @Teslarati Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Yes
@Teslarati Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!

@Erdayastronaut Yes
@TFM312 @Tesla Glad you’re ok!
@flcnhvy @ElonAccessories @teslaownersSV @Teslarati You never know …
@DMC_Ryan @justpaulinelol @Teslarati Exactly
@ElonAccessories @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati No, but very close
@DanielCardena @Teslarati Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago.
@flcnhvy @Teslarati Absolutely
@justpaulinelol @Teslarati New Roadster and X will come later
@ZainRaz4 @Teslarati No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
@Teslarati It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.
@BocachicaMaria1 Thanks, I will stop by on the 20th!
@bonnienorman @Model3Owners They’re available through the app, but we need to make them easier to find

@Teslarati Feeling Lucky (Google tribute!) or Hungry are 100% intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner. If location has destination chargers, that’s a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. This will be hit &amp; miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time.

@TeslaTested Yes, coming soon
@TheCriticofvg Oh that would be fun. Will see.
Joe Mode is the best mode https://t.co/UyvCSTEvNp
Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ♥️♥️ https://t.co/ATUEfTKYQU
@GaryTheBot_ Wise words from Gary the Bot
However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9. https://t.co/V1rNPM1Hdk
@TeslaForLife @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed
@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
@justpaulinelol @31WA Hopefully, next year

@tesla_truth Exactly
@kierank_ @Teslarati Looks good
@MemesOfMars @Teslarati The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
@nate_mccomb @Teslarati 48 61 20 68 61
@Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
@Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.
@Erdayastronaut @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric 🤣🤣
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability.
@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Most likely
@EvaFoxU @justpaulinelol @flcnhvy @tarimnazmi Photoshop is amazing
@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle

Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)
For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains.
@AWintersong Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
@chandanudawat Very exciting to see India’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall.

@TeslaTrip @arctechinc We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks
@universal_sci Wow
@arctechinc Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes
@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun).
@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
@eatinggaming94 @4thFromOurStar 🤣🤣
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
@SciGuySpace @hover389 AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based.

@EcoHeliGuy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge 🤣🤣
@bluemoondance74 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real.
@ajtourville @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B
@Tesla Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels
@TTVBaconz @Tesla Yes
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut Between $100B and $10T
@Erdayastronaut Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
@Erdayastronaut For sure
@Erdayastronaut Yup

@vincent13031925 Yeah, George is a little nuts, but I like him &amp; he often has interesting things to say
@JaneidyEve @Teslarati No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
@Teslarati Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.
Thanks George! https://t.co/ccWYz9FqhH
@brunosilva @vincent13031925 @ResidentSponge @Teslarati @Tesla We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world.
@cleantechnica But actual road data is what matters most https://t.co/q44lsjJZZa
@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
@HarryStoltz1 @Sofiaan @IIHS_autosafety @atj721 Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …

@TeslaClubIN @Yashwanthnadal For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
@hi__hassan Not sure. Will check with my team.
@Yashwanthnadal I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
@SciGuySpace Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.

@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
@JeanLikeDenim Probably
@ropiko Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them &amp; we won’t be able to.
@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week

@joe_mckirdy @13ericralph31 @JHC2718 @StephanieeeeeJ 100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets.

@Rec1pr0city Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident &amp; do our best to minimize probability of recurrence.
@Globe_Mars @CNBC We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth &amp; becoming multiplanetary via Mars. It’s not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better.
@gagansachdev4 Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians &amp; cyclists especially.

@Alpsoy66 Is this true @CGrantWSJ?
@NebraskaJR @Ninja FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
@NebraskaJR @Ninja Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
@Ninja Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.
Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We ♥️♥️♥️ you!! https://t.co/WJqU03wrNH

@naturenick We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
@cleantechnica 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That’s actually kinda true
@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent.
@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
@Cocalarix @romaarra Probably sooner
@romaarra Ok
@TherrinKSCVC @SteelSully @annerajb @kickber @ExploreSpaceKSC Sure, that would be an honor
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @MattLBates Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

@MattLBates @Erdayastronaut I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
@SptlightVids @SpaceX Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
@SpaceXUpdates @Erdayastronaut High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.

Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

@joe_mckirdy @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Depends on destination
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.

@cleantechnica Yup
@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
@John_Gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
@GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6 https://t.co/NllMXregRg
@varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
@meme0boi Fair
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

@nichegamer @flcnhvy @Erik2be @Teslarati Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket
@flcnhvy @Erik2be @Teslarati Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that aren’t
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX ~2.8m
@alijamalashraf @Erdayastronaut @MichaelGalanin @SpaceX Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber.
@Erdayastronaut @Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy @marstronauts @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Horizontally
@flcnhvy @Malcolmmarsman @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
@InsideEVs So it goes
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX 3 months
@flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Hopefully, 4 months
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees
@tommleach @trigomemetry https://t.co/ViY0WgtfOZ
@trigomemetry Sure
@DirkSmit76 Two tunnels about a mile long each
@Debapratim15 @curiousmind44 @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @JeffBezos Yes
@curiousmind44 @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @JeffBezos Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
@_ishanspatil @SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.
@13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Aspirationally
@JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX 3 sea level optimized Raptors, 3 vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)
@13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX After the GoT finale, we dropped it to 6
@SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least 3 engines, maybe all 6
@bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer
Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year. https://t.co/cSSO4SrpFq
@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers.
@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX But, essentially, the spinning things
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower.

@bluemoondance74 @space_terp @NASASpaceflight SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them.

@Torgo82 @FredericLambert Absolutely
@billseymour Seriously
@FredericLambert Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez …
@FredericLambert Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true.
@teslaownersSV @jeffleach Thanks, support super appreciated
@jeffleach Sad if true 😔
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never … https://t.co/bT2ZbnN8Yd
@martinengwicht @msitver @FrankLuntz Anti-matter def wins on energy density 🤣🤣

@ValueAnalyst1 @peterdevietien @scottwww @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles.

@scottwww @ValueAnalyst1 @karpathy @Tesla @nvidia Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.

@shraddha_261291 @WhatTheFFacts Yeah, gave everything I had to Tesla in Dec 2008
@sjensenknight It’s not a big deal. Charge to 90% to 95% &amp; you’ll be fine. At 100% state of charge, regen braking doesn’t work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient.

@DannyLaShep With steel membrane wings like a Dragon, we may be able to lower Starship’s orbital reentry temp to ~1000 degrees C, which would allow the whole surface to be uncooled bare metal
@jasonsellspa Starship will land on a ring of fire
@JaneidyEve 6.5
@Johankyu7 Yes
Winter is coming
Thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to Starship
@EforElectric @WSJ That tweet did take immense effort 🤣🤣 Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps.

@cleantechnica Good interview by @lexfridman
@Louisbotelho17 @Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Truth
@johnrobb Exactly
@Kristennetten @arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement How embarrassing. Will change.
@Chapter11Cases We will. You read it right.
@arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Haha true
@martinengwicht @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb @Tesla @ElonMuskScience I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
@cSharp3x7 @Savis1949 @WSJ Good point, small oil is a problem too
@FredericLambert @GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels …
@GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
@GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ True, Bloomberg is almost as bad
@Savis1949 @WSJ Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
@grzf_ Starship is kinda Gundam
@KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
@Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.
@nichegamer @NCBirbhan @CBSNews Mint berry crunch
@Teslarati poetic justice
@NCBirbhan @CBSNews Boring candy coming soon …
@CBSNews Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop.
@tsrandall Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
@tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints.
@CalinRoman3 @GregMatson Yes
@GregMatson Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
@Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
@FredericLambert Yes
@yaypie There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
@Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
@kneibert Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
@frozencanuck Something like that
Starting May 1
Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time

@annerajb @TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Any user input counts
@TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change.

@PatrickWStanley @LivingTesla @Tesla Yes
@MitchellHagan @MarcelFeldkamp Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars
@MarcelFeldkamp That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.
@JohnnaCrider1 @patrickc @Tesla Thanks 😀

@bluemoondance74 @solussd @Tesla I’m told it’s looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
@solussd @Tesla Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
@slye @LivingTesla @Tesla Impressive analysis
@LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera.
@LivingTesla @Tesla Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window.
@LivingTesla @Tesla It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.
@LeoDotWalsh0x05 Will take care of it
@dave_chung @Tesla Ok

@jake_cooley @SnazzyQ Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input.
@EV_Stevee @Tesla Great name 👍
@SnazzyQ Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It’s not just a settings change.
@SherylCrow @Tesla Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup.

@GaragedoorsGman @SherylCrow @Tesla Agreed
@SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

@TesLatino @mcjamez @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Tesla Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest
@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible.
@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. https://t.co/lICMpT7xnX
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
@DiscoverMag We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there …
@erinwinick @techreview Super cool!
@martin_galway Good point

@Some1gg Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.
@Kristennetten No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles https://t.co/PycE9VthxQ
@Mathias_Wehler @Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots
@Sloppy93 @Erdayastronaut @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Only some of the hottest sections
@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Full size
@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
@THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
@omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout …
@flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
@austinbarnard45 First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.

@AskDrStupid @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Yes!
@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren’t so crazy
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity.
@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.
@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway 🇳🇴 has highest Tesla cars per person on 🌏 (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

@TonyTesla4Life @tesla_truth @FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla Correct

@brandynspears 6
@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
@johnny0129 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference — about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
@soundanswer @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Yes
@marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too

@cleantechnica True
@Drew78823936 @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although they’re critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.
@DJSnM @RocketTenor @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn’t have same safety criticality as crew.
@dmk184 @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
@iamkostmos @NASA @SpaceX @Space_Station @Commercial_Crew Most likely, but this is contingent upon NASA review &amp; approval

@Sofiaan @royalflushGK Will take a few days for system update
@TonyCrisostomo @tesla_truth @royalflushGK Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back.
@abhaygupta @royalflushGK It’s not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term

@katlinegrey @lrocket @Alexis_wwww Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder.
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel.
@annerajb @flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Yes, exciting potential
@flcnhvy @DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly
@annerajb @lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet.
@DrivingSlate @TeslaParaTodos @JenniferSensiba @cleantechnica @28delayslater Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
@lrocket @Alexis_wwww @katlinegrey Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!

@rogiermaas @SpaceX Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
@Erdayastronaut @CanzyD Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters.
@SpaceXUpdates @CanzyD Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so
@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.
@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.

@benoitdenayer @navincho @katlinegrey Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
@RichPitre_CO @katlinegrey We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don’t know
@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd
@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

@SPEXcast @McMurchie @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp; setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!
@McMurchie @SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper
@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.
@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes
@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs
@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by @SpaceX engine/test team! https://t.co/yPrvO0JhyY

@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
@Malcolmmarsman @Erdayastronaut Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
@Erdayastronaut Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
@Erdayastronaut The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy

@nickynaptime Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn’t even need paint!
@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
@TriTexan @SpaceX Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).

@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine
@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
@CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.

@DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
@thecla6771 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
@PopMech When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

@WevolverApp @SpaceX Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it’s not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings
@cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication
@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:
https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA"
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M

@nextPlanetOver @WorldAndScience Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
@WorldAndScience Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time. https://t.co/rIks4ZHuCO

@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions.
@BENBALLER Thanks!
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.
@NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
@Erdayastronaut @ludan27 @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem.
@_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀
@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
@John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Coldformed at cryo
@Malcolmmarsman @TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly
@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
@wangmeister It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end
@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi
"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

@nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won’t matter for the first few layers

Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: https://t.co/LS4EhN57Mw

@DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out
@vicentes @Attack @Tesla Ok 😀💨
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? https://t.co/vxcZ2Hi2qx
@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly
@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
@FredericLambert @boringcompany You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear.
@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better.
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.
@alanrrios @boringcompany Yes
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla

@John_Papa @Tesla You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
@Malcolmmarsman Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
@business Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”.
@annerajb About 10 to 14 days
Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)
"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.

@MesQueUnBanjo We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
@ghhaugen Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability.
Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.
@RenataKonkoly @SpaceX Machete!!
@danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. https://t.co/NxCgYO9JXx
@nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.
@brandonorselli Buying https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like https://t.co/BsRfMrY9Gm even when we were only making 🚘.
Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. https://t.co/zPnrrVash1

@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal
@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.

Tracking shot of Falcon water landing https://t.co/6Hv2aZhLjM
Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon. https://t.co/O3h8eCgGJ7
@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.
@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.
Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.

@Jennerator211 @PPathole @JohnnaCrider1 We’re adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months
@JohnnaCrider1 Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.

@bonnienorman @tomb2192 @carpenter_maas Ok
@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice
@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you’re ok
@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.
@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.

Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)
Renaming BFR to Starship
@universal_sci No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR
@YoBigBrotha Yes
Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok
@ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
@WillFealey Investigating
@vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019
@LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
@WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not.
@acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
@ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years
@stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app.
@jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers
@WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed https://t.co/ITPgR9BeGz
@FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive.
@FrameshiftShark Radical change
Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.
@annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times. https://t.co/vQCcrwZgmC

@vincent13031925 Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain
@madera_raul Yes
Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.
@FredericLambert We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
@victorpoughon Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location.

Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
@SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far … https://t.co/TvyuDBf3lR
@zandywithaz Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
@JackCydia Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.
If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
@tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point, will reenable
@mihk101 Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety.
Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
@exzacklyright @MKBHD @austinnotduncan @Tesla Cool
@Tesla With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster
@Erdayastronaut @Tesla Yes
@Tesla Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
@Erdayastronaut @annerajb No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas
@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
@annerajb Aiming for orbital flight by June

@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020
@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!

@CGasparino @Tesla The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
@Model3Owners Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
@Lindowitz @FredericLambert It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …
@CGasparino @Tesla Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?
@sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars
@rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund
@ctgm @FredericLambert Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer
@FredericLambert Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
@annerajb @FredericLambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey Exactly. That’s Monday.
@officialjaden Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm.

@sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal.

@FactsDataTruth @Tesla You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great.

@FredericLambert Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.
To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.
@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars

Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so
@dennishegstad It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see.
Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires.
@DannyMekic It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February

@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.

@JacksMacintosh @SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert I believe it’s $5k
@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.

@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point 😀
@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!
@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide. https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR

@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking.
@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder
@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.
@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
@Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time

@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side
@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts
Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.
@Cardoso @NHTSAgov Haha true
.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.

@ddkilzer Yes
@thereal_scottv Yeah, that’s our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks.
Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour.

@yanquetino @Tesla Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs.
@j_brorsson @InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …
@InsideEVs @Tesla @AirResources Maybe …
@AskDrStupid This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors.

Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth. https://t.co/mm0cpaQLsn
@jack_p That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.
@stfuszn @jack_p So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
@jack_p Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone.

@Tesla Whether you plan to buy a Dual Motor Performance Model 3 or not, take it for a test drive anyway. It’s like having pure fun jacked straight into your brain whenever you want.
@Tesla @92107Runner Performance version suspension is 1cm lower &amp; has stronger brakes in upgrade package
@Malala @MalalaFund Happy birthday, Malala! Happy to support.
@designheretic @LittleMissFlint Gathering input this week, will begin taking action next week and let people know how they can help
@M3CHWARRI0R935 @itsMikeSki @deadpoolmovie Even have the URL https://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy
@WintersPB @itsMikeSki Hmm, could def make some pretty sweet high-tech micro-missiles in arrow form
@itsMikeSki If you have cool arrows, you’re in
@ToddKorpi @StarFire2258 Ok, thanks. Will let you know.
@karenaboutflint @DylanSheaMusic Sure, will call tomorrow
@isco__ They should go where their heart takes them, but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics &amp; engineering
Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.
@hohocho Would love to. It’s been too long.
@aparanjape Prob early next year
Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy &amp; vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team &amp; potential for the future.
@thanr Sure 🌌 💫
@Mickyni111 Look, at least it’s not the Magellanic Clouds. They’re basically next door.
Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. It’s amazing. https://t.co/eLqr4pLeIX
So true https://t.co/DLagzIxyHm
@Vivek_17m @thanr The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
@thanr Sounds good
@thanr Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
@vissmeerr @ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET It will happen for sure. Damn.
@ArsenalDem @pvols1979 @CNET Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
@tammyharrington @d20_highroller Damn, now I want donuts 🍩
@d20_highroller Yeah
@shplatt @StarFire2258 Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
@StarFire2258 You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.
@jonodiener Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
@jonodiener For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow.
@DylanSheaMusic Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
@jack Great move
@vanschneider Why sir … 😊
Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
@KirklandJones Good point
@annerajb Definitely. Can’t wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon.
@ZainRaz4 Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline
Well … it looked smaller on paper
Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big https://t.co/WMeNZeksRq
@Katheri93719178 @dtemkin Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.
@JohnnaSabri @dtemkin It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
@RockyPruitt @kulpability @DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Makes a lot of sense
@dtemkin This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
@hankgreen @eehouls Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
@DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Please lmk results of your water tests
@DonAndrewBailey @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?
@DMC_Ryan Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
@bevvscott @eehouls Exactly
@eehouls No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?
@HelloCullen Already have
@blake_kistler @BBCWorld Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
@LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.
@Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point
@BBCWorld Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
@BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: https://t.co/dmC9l3jiZR
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. https://t.co/EHNh8ydaTT
@Noizey_Man @JaneidyEve That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
@EnochKo @Anna_online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
@JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
@Anna_online According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage https://t.co/2z01Ut3vxJ
@2morrowknight Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
@bweikle According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
@binarybits @JaneidyEve Tube diameter is 31cm
@JaneidyEve Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
@imscoops It is an honor to work with them
With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space

@IAmJohnMcMahon I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
@DocJohnG @PewellaClarke @dcliem It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
@KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
@PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.
@astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
@dcliem  https://t.co/jL2sPT0NCp
@dcliem Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
@MontanaSeptic @dcliem Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand
@dcliem Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.

@sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot 🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤
@dcliem Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
@KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Turbo
@Grady_Booch @slashdot C
@ayshardzn Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
@DowdEdward Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://t.co/t5XRo3gTxK
@slashdot Yes
@dirkbonhomme @JelteDesign @maysacha Yes
@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
@abroadwithalec @maysacha Yes
@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
@thanr @ablack82 I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand
Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.
@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would
@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
@jevjack1 Can’t be too buoyant
Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.
@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea
@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
@LittleMissFlint You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
@jeremysliew It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
@erikveen I would def recommend this
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks
@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won’t come in
@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
@MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said
@jowens510 @lopezlinette I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
@lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? https://t.co/jy7sQkZ4R5
@S_Padival @lopezlinette Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective https://t.co/eaLVIgwm7k
@S_Padival @lopezlinette  https://t.co/ystkbF7p1W
@S_Padival @lopezlinette .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective https://t.co/oy1Tz6Cg68
@Rayhawn @Tesla Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so.
@ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism.
@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?
@TeslaBull What a coincidence …
@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?
@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer.
@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion.
Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://t.co/xSG2Mmy756
@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?
@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters.
@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?
@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target.

@PPathole @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.

@JohnnaSabri @RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact True
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”
@RehearsalLot @guiscaesar @surfersnout @aedmondsauthor @barbiesway @TwitterMoments @RepMaxineWaters @PolitiFact “All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”

@GetMyGist As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all.
@xkcdComic This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
@lazarusrang Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got
@xkcdComic Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all.
@docjkcardinal @WorldAndScience Let’s find out. It would be amazing to encounter an alien civilization, provided it is not their invasion fleet! 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸 🛸
@DMC_Ryan @tkraenze @Tesla Good news coming soon
@Cardoso Yes
@thescalex Yes, we are essentially a steward of life &amp; duty-bound imo to ensure its continuance
@Rossputin Life is good
It is unknown whether we are the only civilization currently alive in the observable universe, but any chance that we are is added impetus for extending life beyond Earth
This is why we must preserve the light of consciousness by becoming a spacefaring civilization &amp; extending life to other planets https://t.co/UDDP8I1zsS
@WorldAndScience So strange
@DMC_Ryan @tkraenze @Tesla Critical autonomous safety features like emergency braking are standard, but convenience features like active cruise control are not
@jclishman @Justin_Ebright It’s a tough call. Reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a self-driving car, as it will always yield. Will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane changes.
@Justin_Ebright We considered going beyond Mad Max to “LA Freeway” level, but that’s too loco

@FredericLambert @Model3Owners That would be tricky to sequence, but maybe
@Model3Owners Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car &amp; understand how they come together. I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid (or now).
@disapr_ @cybik It’s called Top Secret
@cybik Yes
@CateLuvsLondon @vicentes @S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college.
@vicentes @S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag Yeah, but I’m not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better.
@ddkilzer @wk057 @Tesla We will add a config to lower the alert
@wk057 @Tesla Apply light force to the steering wheel. Alert is being changed to this text.
@zaphodgjd Thanks for the feedback, will investigate
@corywright Sure
@ToscaMusk @westcoastbill @PassionFlix @RachVD @itsNickBateman Congratulations!
@S_Padival @bourgeoisalien @jacobinmag It’s actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people &amp; good for environment. I think that’s fundamental goodness.

@erikbryn @vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Today. It’s kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn’t change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
@adultswim Because honey is a vegetable
@Santiago7K @xJawz @joerogan Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
@PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly
@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He’s obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.
@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.
@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That’s really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money” is.
@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.

@cfarivar @PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @EBRPD I’m at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. It’s big.
@cfarivar @PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter They look beautiful
@cfarivar @loosecoosebbq @akrdu2 @Tesla @Fremont_CA Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
@PPathole @dawg_fan_93 @maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
@maysacha @JayPrisefighter @cfarivar Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
@JayPrisefighter @cfarivar They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
@joshsteimle @monongahelaEX @AntVenom No
@cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ♥️🚘💫
@scottlynch78 @jenphalian You’re welcome, bad fiction writer 78 https://t.co/ypglGbdEse
@cfarivar @amendlocke Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can’t even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer.
@amendlocke Your union brothers https://t.co/DsGvlscvc6
@amendlocke You won’t find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
@Keith_Wasserman @Jason @Beyonce @warriors Thanks, good advice
@FredericLambert @SwiftOnSecurity They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
@c7five Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I’m driving.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin @RickandMorty Can’t wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start!
@goombar3 We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
@taimurstriker Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.
@mk_rodgers They started it &amp; attacked me personally
Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization. https://t.co/9RVR31vzbc
@SwiftOnSecurity They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
@haymarketbooks Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.
@SwiftOnSecurity Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware.
@doctorow @sahazel Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldn’t care less.
@JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?
@JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Iron pyrite
@JimPuzzanghera Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
@spookyozzy @slack2thefuture @doctorow You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail &amp; be back in 3 months.
@TeslaCharts I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.
@slack2thefuture @doctorow You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
Well said https://t.co/lDPaIPLLzO
@TeslaCharts Then you’ll be fine
@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate.
@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too.
@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
@AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
@doctorow Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case.

@NelStamp @RRescenko If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔
@kikkerin @soniasimone Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness.
@Gubisoul @monongahelaEX @AntVenom That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
@soniasimone lol

@elmaddogg @tinytacotown No
@tinytacotown My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
@CarltonTSC There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation.
Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people’s freedom.
@Jack_Frodo Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs

@joerogan @Off_thewalls @MKBHD Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
@garyflickinger @OchamsRazr @VR0NLINE Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we’re never going to make them again.
@Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof.
@Caio_1999_ @LanceUlanoff Not recommended for urban environments
@ThatGuyKnapp @LanceUlanoff Yes
@poriya_ravi @WorldAndScience The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
@oheather1337 @WorldAndScience It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
@WorldAndScience Love this design. Simpler the better.
@DeeLex_MCEM @VHollywood21 Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
@raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
@Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
@VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
@MKBHD Will do
@bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another.
@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔
Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
@trace_remick @FredericLambert 20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
@FredericLambert In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
@FredericLambert That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://t.co/HPK5R5UMS6
At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
@FrankIppolito @boringcompany We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
@djenkins6 Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …

Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower https://t.co/HewJf66hh2
First 1000 Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today! https://t.co/hBMp5fGzAB
@teslaology @DMC_Ryan @Tesla We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
@DMC_Ryan Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
@pmnordkvist Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
@Nate_072 @SpaceX Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter
And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
@MKBHD Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form …
Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this https://t.co/563upTfV58
@DMC_Ryan No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars.
@jovanik21 @Tesla Working on improving
@ElliottGotkine No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, 7 mins is obv right.
@dprzygoda Oh please, that’s obv overkill
Tip of the day … https://t.co/MjbYlseX45
@lexiheft @Tesla Coming soon
@shwetp We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years.
@WSJ Congratulations @murraymatt. Good move by @WSJ. Please use Matt’s Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
@ang3lwtf Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of 4
Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little https://t.co/06IA9Xy6bL
@sonic_hedgehog Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but … https://t.co/RPpOchBMKJ
@SquarePeg44 @cassianelwes We have about 11,000 projects underway in Puerto Rico
@cassianelwes Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
@Jamie_Sullivan4 @Model3Owners You should get an invite to configure in next few days
@MacTechGenius @Model3Owners Definitely
@Heretic_Soul @Model3Owners Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.
@Model3Owners Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.
@RReardonT @Tesla Next year
@heron_ziegel @jasminrohman Twitter is so dark …
@jkunkel2 No … no …
@jasminrohman That is horrifying
@AlexGuichet Indeed, the esthetics of cutlery are a source of great stress
Mason jars with a handle or wine stem cause me to lose faith in humanity
@RacusinJennifer @tycoonmindset05 The future
@SpiritosoV @KumJm @STcom Exactly!
@tycoonmindset05 I was an alien 🛸👽♥️💫
@NathanWickland @STcom Actually true!
@KumJm @STcom Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.
@STcom But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything’s just fine https://t.co/cg4ooQSrX3
@STcom Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
@STcom The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
Glad you’re ok! https://t.co/zuuYCUIKus
Some details on the Tesla air filtration system https://t.co/kRPwg7TGsu
@nickg_uk Mid 2019 for RHD
@nashlib That sounds like a fun adventure!
@nickg_uk You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
@Arkved78 Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little 🥜 on S/X.
Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind https://t.co/dlQHJfKdpU
@Seanmmvi @OlofTenghoff @Tesla Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3.
Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus https://t.co/gIELCeXN1C

@Malala Hi @Malala! 💕👻😅
@unicorn @MacTechGenius @v_g_fischer @ConsumerReports Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
Hell of a week https://t.co/jKsfykkG55
@Edwardpumps Just for perspective https://t.co/ZfMR1aOinY
@johnny0129 @jeffnesbit @Tesla True, no one is perfect
@JeffreyWolder @jeffnesbit @Tesla You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
@jeffnesbit @Tesla Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism.
@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.
@annerajb @Henry_Pivac Prob 8.3
@Henry_Pivac Yes
All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description. https://t.co/ea7FTOn2cE
@prakash_d @grillick @IndianInterest “Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
@v_g_fischer @ConsumerReports Yeah, absolutely
Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month. https://t.co/ZMLPJxmPlM
Like you guys too 🚘 🖤 https://t.co/PVQVyR1nXY
@IndianInterest Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered.
@yoyovinzi Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should.
@annerajb @eli_schiff Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
@eli_schiff Peace ✌️
@ClaytonGoobert Love the space cowboy esthetic
@AndreaSJames ♥️
At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.
@kevinmgill You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a “good person”?
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite! https://t.co/aXPsmLnh48
@HahTse @neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried “Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman.
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.
@neilhimself @AnozieUdemezue @upulie @davidkfried Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up.
@NoahShachtman @thedailybeast @erinbiba You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too
@amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @Sra_Mister @waitbutwhy Great book. Read it when it came out.
@amasad @its_a_massacre @fung9815 @israrayyaz @Sra_Mister @waitbutwhy Exactly
@rhinopIasty SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.
@amasad @Sra_Mister Yeah
@amasad @Sra_Mister Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
@JohnnaSabri @Sra_Mister Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
@PPathole @Sra_Mister Yes
@WorldAndScience You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
@G_Whitehead5 @DMC_Ryan @Model3Owners @Tesla Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money.
@davidtayar5 @annerajb @LikeTeslaKim I really want to make this cupholder
@LikeTeslaKim I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs
@LikeTeslaKim Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
@JohnnaSabri @AffinPub @thesmelloftea You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.
@nealcol Good school
@StarVenge @ChiTownMadison @JohnnaSabri @joshuatopolsky @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Had a great time with my kids
@ChiTownMadison @JohnnaSabri @joshuatopolsky @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Yes
@joshuatopolsky @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media. https://t.co/c01JolZENY
@TeslaTurk Thanks 😀
@arieleax @utkuspace 2020
@utkuspace Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
@oneunderscore__ @joshuatopolsky @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear.
@minliangtan @taglia Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
@PassionPlanet1 @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …
@joshuatopolsky @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media.
@oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
@ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @oneunderscore__ @ashleyfeinberg Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media
@RBryant2012 Yup, deleted
@MacTechGenius @DMC_Ryan @ConsumerReports ? It should
@davinalexmma @DMC_Ryan No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky 20” tires.
@DMC_Ryan Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes

@AntVenom @BoredElonMusk Sometimes even I think we’re the same person!
@omcintyre @CrampedEyes @SpaceX @Tesla @upulie Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender &amp; make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues.

But femtotech is the future … https://t.co/NODkOer8oS
Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought. https://t.co/NMAks4jrZ1
@dimas_______ @AlexCJoachim @RitNagar @jbinero @hubertlepicki @Jason @nytimes @BretStephensNYT The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh... https://t.co/vZbyUY1rf4
@TKhopshanosov @SaxMike71 @ebol94 @teslainventory @Tesla A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
@nitantbhartia @ninoles @medickinson @thephysicsgirl Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games.
@ssBlueStockings @ninoles @medickinson @thephysicsgirl It’s cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a “rocket scientist” in aerospace, they would think you’re 🙃
